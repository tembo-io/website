# Dissecting pgmq

In my [previous submission](https://tembo.io/blog/pgmq-with-python) to this space, I described my experience with [pgmq](https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq) while using the Python library. In this post, I'll share what I have found after inspecting the code.

So, first, I'll describe the general structure of the project, which uses [pgrx](https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx). Then, I'll explain what happens when we install the pgmq extension. Finally, I'll describe how some of its functions work.

In this post, I'll be using version v0.20.0, which you can find [here](https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq/releases/tag/v0.20.0).


## Project structure
After cloning the appropriate tag, we can see that the repository contains the following files:

```bash
> ls -1
Cargo.lock
Cargo.toml
CONTRIBUTING.md
core
Dockerfile.build
examples
images
LICENSE
Makefile
pgmq.control
pgmq-rs
README.md
sql
src
tembo-pgmq-python
tests
```

From the pgrx [README](https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx/blob/develop/README.md), we know that the relevant files for the extension are `Cargo.toml`, `pgmq.control` and the `src` and `sql` directories:

```bash
> tree sql src
sql
├── pgmq--0.10.2--0.11.1.sql
├── pgmq--0.11.1--0.11.2.sql
...
├── pgmq--0.8.0--0.8.1.sql
├── pgmq--0.8.1--0.9.0.sql
└── pgmq--0.9.0--0.10.2.sql
src
├── api.rs
├── errors.rs
├── lib.rs
├── metrics.rs
└── partition.rs

0 directories, 5 files
```

## Installing the pgmq extension

To build the pgmq extension, we can do the following:

```bash
> cargo build
```

Alternatively, to build and install the pgmq extension, we can do:

```bash
> cargo pgrx install
```

In either case, we can see a shared library `pgmq.so` being created. The installation process also places the shared library in the `lib` directory of the postgres installation; and the sql files and the control file in the `extensions` directory. In my case:

```
> ls -1 /opt/postgres/share/extension/pgmq*
/opt/postgres/share/extension/pgmq--0.10.2--0.11.1.sql
...
/opt/postgres/share/extension/pgmq--0.9.0--0.10.2.sql
/opt/postgres/share/extension/pgmq.control

> ls -1 /opt/postgres/lib/pgmq*
/opt/postgres/lib/pgmq.so
```
To test the extension, we can do:

```
> cargo pgrx run
```
and it'll start a `psql` prompt. In the prompt, we can execute the `create extension` statement to start using pgmq:

```
pgmq=# \dx
                 List of installed extensions
  Name   | Version |   Schema   |         Description
---------+---------+------------+------------------------------
 plpgsql | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language
(1 row)

pgmq=# create extension pgmq;
CREATE EXTENSION

pgmq=# \dx
                                     List of installed extensions
  Name   | Version |   Schema   |                             Description

 plpgsql | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language
(2 rows)
```

We can also list the available functions:
```

(17 rows)
```

With this, we can now explore the extension from the inside. And, if needed, recompile and reinstall the extension to play with it.


## The internals

We know that when an extension is created with pgrx, it generates a `lib.rs` file. Let us explore it.

One of the first thing we can see, is that the other four files in the `src/` directory are included:

```rust
pub mod api;
pub mod errors;
pub mod metrics;
pub mod partition;
```

We also see that it imports stuff from another module, the one in `core/`:

```rust
use pgmq_core::{
    errors::PgmqError,
    query::{archive, archive_batch, delete, delete_batch, init_queue, pop, read},
    types::{PGMQ_SCHEMA, TABLE_PREFIX},
    util::check_input,
};
```

So, at this point we know we can find the source code in two places: `src/` and `core/`. 

If we continue exploring `lib.rs`, we can see that it declares some sql that gets executed when the extension is enabled:

```rust
extension_sql!(
    "
CREATE TABLE public.pgmq_meta (
    queue_name VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);
...
```

We can actually see that table with psql:

```
pgmq-# \dt
           List of relations
 Schema |   Name    | Type  |  Owner
--------+-----------+-------+----------
 public | pgmq_meta | table | binidxaba
(1 row)

pgmq=# select * from pgmq_meta;
 queue_name | created_at
------------+------------
(0 rows)
```
From this point, we can suspect that every time we create a queue, a new row is inserted into this table.

Let us see what `pgmq_create()` does...


### pgmq\_create()

If we chase the call sequence, we can discover that the interesting function is `init_queue(queue_name)`:

```rust
pub fn init_queue(name: &str) -> Result<Vec<String>, PgmqError> {
    let name = CheckedName::new(name)?;
    Ok(vec![
        create_queue(name)?,
        assign_queue(name)?,
        create_index(name)?,
        create_archive(name)?,
        assign_archive(name)?,
        create_archive_index(name)?,
        insert_meta(name)?,
        grant_pgmon_queue(name)?,
    ])
}
```
This function generates several sql statements that are later executed in `pgmq_create_non_partitioned` using a [`Spi` client](https://docs.rs/pgx/latest/pgx/spi/struct.SpiClient.html).

I'll skip the details, but the sql statements basically do:
1. Create a table `pgmq_<queue_name>`.
2. Assign the table to the pqmg extension.
3. Create an index on the `pgmq_<queue_name>` table.
4. Create a table `pgmq_<queue_name>_archive`.
5. Assign the table to the pgmq extension.
6. Create an index on the `pgmq_<queue_name>_archive` table.
7. Insert a row on the `pgmq_meta` table.
8. Grant privileges to `pg_monitor`.

We can see the effects of this in psql:
```
pgmq=# select pgmq_create('my_queue');
 pgmq_create
-------------

(1 row)

pgmq=# \dt
                 List of relations
 Schema |         Name          | Type  |  Owner
--------+-----------------------+-------+----------
 public | pgmq_meta             | table | binidxaba
 public | pgmq_my_queue         | table | binidxaba
 public | pgmq_my_queue_archive | table | binidxaba
(3 rows)

pgmq=# \di
                               List of relations                                                                                                                                              
 Schema |            Name            | Type  |  Owner    |         Table         
--------+----------------------------+-------+-----------+-----------------------
 public | archived_at_idx_my_queue   | index | binidxaba | pgmq_my_queue_archive
 public | pgmq_meta_queue_name_key   | index | binidxaba | pgmq_meta
 public | pgmq_my_queue_archive_pkey | index | binidxaba | pgmq_my_queue_archive
 public | pgmq_my_queue_pkey         | index | binidxaba | pgmq_my_queue
 public | pgmq_my_queue_vt_idx       | index | binidxaba | pgmq_my_queue
(5 rows)

pgmq=# select * from pgmq_meta;
 queue_name |          created_at
------------+-------------------------------
 my_queue   | 2023-08-30 07:00:42.467084-06
(1 row)
```

For the queue `my_queue`, we can see the underlying table and the corresponding archive table. Each table has an index associated with the primary key. The `pgmq_my_queue` table also has an index on the `vt` column, and `pgmq_my_queue_archive` has an index on the `archived_at` column.

We can suspect that the `pgmq_my_queue` table is used in the send and read operations. Let us look at those two functions.


### pgmq\_send()

`pgmq_send` is straightforward, it just inserts a new row in the the underlying table:

```sql
INSERT INTO {PGMQ_SCHEMA}.{TABLE_PREFIX}_{name} (vt, message)
VALUES (now(), $1)
RETURNING msg_id; 
```


### pgmq\_read()


So, let's see. If I were the one programming `pgmq_read()`, I would perhaps do something like "get the first {limit} rows from the queue table whose {vt} has already expired, and for those rows, also update the visibility timeout to `now() + {vt}`." Naively, maybe something like:

```sql
update pgmq_my_queue
SET      
    vt = clock_timestamp() + interval '10 seconds',                                            
    read_ct = read_ct + 1                                                                      
WHERE  
    msg_id in (select msg_id from pgmq_my_queue where vt <= clock_timestamp()                                                      
        ORDER BY msg_id ASC                                                                            
        LIMIT 1);  
```

In reality, `pgmq_read` is more interesting than that :sweat_smile:. It performs the following DML:

```sql

Firstly, in pgmq's version, there is a CTE (Common Table Expression) to obtain the first `{limit}` message IDs whose `vt` has expired. Notice the `order by` clause that ensures the FIFO ordering. Also, notice the `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` clause claiming the rows no one else has claimed. This part is essential because it ensures correctness in the case of concurrent  `pgmq_read()` operations. 

The next step is to update the corresponding rows with a new `vt` value by adding the supplied `{vt}` to the current timestamp. Additionally, the `read_ct` value is incremented by 1. I couldn't figure out the use of this column, though. It is *maybe* intended to be used by the application to count how many times the messages were read.

It would be interesting to talk about why pgmq developers chose to use a CTE, but that's a topic for a different post.


### pgmq\_drop\_queue()

Finally, let's talk about `pgmq_drop_queue()`. It essentially executes multiple statements:

1. Unassign the `pgmq_<queue_name>` table from the extension.
2. Unassign the `pgmq_<queue_name>_archive` table from the extension.
3. Drop the table `pgmq_<queue_name>`.
4. Drop the table `pgmq_<queue_name>_archive`.
5. Delete the corresponding row from the `pgmq_meta` table.

Nothing surprising in this one. 


## Conclusion

In this post, we explored how the pgrx tool is used to generate the pgmq extension. We explored how the metadata objects are created and how they are used in the basic send and read operations. At least from an explorer perspective, the internals of the extension are currently easy to read and understand.

I invite everyone to explore how the other pgmq functions work. You can explore the code at https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq. And you can learn more about pgrx at: https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx.
