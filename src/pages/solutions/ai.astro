			titleQuote='“Tembo makes Postgres easy for us.”'
			quote=` ”We don’t have to worry about spinning up or tuning it. We get stacks
        that just work out of the box, and we know they are going to be tuned
        without having to do a spike. We now use Tembo to manage a fleet of over
        20 production instances and a number of non-prod and development
        environments, and we’re excited to leverage Tembo for larger and larger
        workloads as our customers ask us for more specialized use cases. Tembo
        has become so fundamental to our platform that we don’t even think about
        alternatives anymore. When you’re not spending time thinking about your
        database, that’s how you know it’s a good solution.”`
