## How to _truly_ make the most of Postgres

Postgres isn't just a database engine, it's a rich ecosystem consisting of [languages](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PL_Matrix), [geospatial](https://postgis.net/), [AI](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector), [queues](https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq), and more, leveraging local or external data from [CSV files](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/file-fdw.html) to [Parquet systems](https://github.com/adjust/parquet_fdw).

We've made a concerted effort to leverage as many of these capabilities as possible. Few databases are as flexible as Postgres in this regard, so why not fully explore the ecosystem? We'll teach you to use Postgres as the middleware it truly is.

## Basic to advanced levels of several concepts:

Learning is a journey, and along the path of building each demo app, we'll need to introduce various concepts in and out of the database field. Which ones? Here are a few based on our existing course outline:

* Data modeling
* SQL
* Application design
* Cluster design
* Deployment
* Scalability
* High Availability
* AI
* Geospatial

We have an entire series of interdisciplinary practices to cover development within an application stack. We mean it when we say we are building real-world applications to demonstrate the adaptability of Postgres.

## Understanding end-to-end system design

All but the most trivial of applications consists of several layers, of which the database is usually a critical part. We are a Postgres company, after all. But there are a myriad of others: queues, caches, messaging, APIs, CDC, pipelines, proxies, front-end and back-end frameworks, CDNs, and more. There's a lot to a fully scalable application, and while it may seem imposing at first, all of these components work in conjunction and many are optional.

The point is not to be overwhelmed, but to consider and _comprehend_ how the layers work. Whether each is strictly necessary depends on the expectations and requirements of what we're building. We're here to help you figure that out along the way.
