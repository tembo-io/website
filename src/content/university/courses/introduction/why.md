We hope that by now, the question of "why" answers itself. But if you still need a bit of help, here's why you might want to attend Tembo University.

## You work in an industry that makes use of data

You do, don't you? _Probably_. The great thing about Postgres is that it's modeled after some fundamental data management concepts dating back to at least [1986](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/history.html). Relational databases power _almost all_ data management systems that power the modern web. Even application stacks that run purely on [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) engines have billing systems that _don't_.

While you learn Postgres, you're learning SQL, data modeling, normalization, query and execution plans, indexing, and a bevy of other concepts that apply across _all_ industries. We at Tembo prefer Postgres, so that's at the root of our examples and material. But what you learn here will go far beyond that.

## You always wanted to know how your favorite sites work

Have you ever gone to a site like [X](https://x.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Uber](https://www.uber.com/), or even [Ticketmaster](https://www.ticketmaster.com/) and wonder how they work? Developers often think about things like this and have _some_ idea. Some may even occasionally build a shallow mental construct when examining sites like this.

These abstractions tend to trivialize or underestimate _critical_ components, or fail to consider others. It's not until you sit down and _actually build something_, that the underlying complexities become an inescapable reality.

We're doing that on your behalf across multiple industries and system stacks. We may not have the secret formula that made these sites famous, but our examples will work, and we'll explain how and why.

## You want to build the next breakthrough app

Tembo is here for all developers who want to use Postgres. Our mission is to deliver the most **reliable**, **dependable**, and **_accessible_** Postgres service available to _any_ developer working to build the next Big Thing.

Part of that dedication is the Tembo University initiative. We've spent decades working with Postgres and know it inside and out. We're _convinced_ that it's a database ecosystem that can empower developers to do great things, and we've designed these lessons to make that vision a reality.

If that describes you, then you've come to the right place.
