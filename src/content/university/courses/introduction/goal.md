We'll get straight to the point: the focus of these courses lies along three central tenants. By the end, you should know every facet of Postgres, and how to build things with it.

## 1. Learn Postgres

We want more Postgres users and developers. We want _you_ to join the Postgres revolution. The best way to learn is by _doing_, so we'll teach you how to do things with Postgres by example.

## 2. Illustrate real-world use cases

The world is not constructed from fantasy. You've seen and used real applications on the web, on mobile devices, at work, and at home. We've categorized and simplified many of the applications out there so we can teach people how they work. Build something real.

## 3. Fully explore the Postgres ecosystem

By now, everyone knows Postgres is [much more than a database engine](https://pgt.dev/). It's a flourishing [ecosystem of tools](https://medium.com/@fengruohang/postgres-is-eating-the-database-world-157c204dcfc4). Quite a few of these will make an appearance in this course material. Make the most of Postgres and let it handle much of the work for you.
