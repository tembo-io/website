Have you ever used [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/)? It's a great utility for publishing a bunch of text content--usually code--online to share with others.

It's a fairly simple web application loved by many. Open the site, paste some code into a text area, and post. It provides a short URL to quickly reach the content for easy dissemination. It also offers some basic account management for personal pastes, categorization, tagging, syntax highlighting, and other functionality.

Have you ever how it works behind the scenes? What the database model looks like? How the content gets organized and displayed? Would you like to try to _build it_?

Well, wonder no longer! The first module in the Tembo University curriculum is to build a working analog of Pastebin, with Postgres at the core of course. It's best to start simple, and we can't think of a better example than this.

Let's get started.
