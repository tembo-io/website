At Tembo, we understand that it's not only about creating an exciting product, but ensuring user success through a well-defined support program. The purpose of this page is to help describe our approach and how we balance resource allocation as our user base grows.

Requests for Support can take many forms, but can be grouped into the following themes:

- **Success of user project(s)**
- **Tembo Platform and its current features**
- **Requests for new features**

The capacity to which we are able to respond to the above are dependent on tiers related to the Tembo Platform subscription plan, i.e., yearly (Premium), monthly (Priority), or none (Hobby).
