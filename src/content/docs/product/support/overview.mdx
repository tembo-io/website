At Tembo, we understand that it's not only about creating an exciting product, but ensuring user success through a well-defined support program. The purpose of this page is to help describe our approach and how we balance resources as our user base grows.

Support can take many forms. For example, is the question related to **our platform and its features**? Or, rather, is it related to support in the form of a **feature request**? Finally, and potentially most crucial, support related to an **issue related to the success of your project**?
