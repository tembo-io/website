## Tembo Enterprise

In the Enterprise Software model, both the control plane and the data plane are 
owned and managed by you, and will live in your cloud account. 

We'll provide you with a way to install and run the control plane, 
data plane and UI in your account so that they can use Tembo Cloud in a 
way that meets your security requirements. 

Extension management is a key feature of the Tembo experience, and the platform makes use of the Trunk extension registry under the hood. You may not be able to use the 
public Trunk registry, so we'll provide a way for you to use your 
own private extension registry.
