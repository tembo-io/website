	we also provide software as a solution as well.

## Tembo Enterprise

In the Enterprise Software model, both the control plane and the data plane are 
owned and managed by you, and will live in your cloud account. 

We'll attempt to provide you with a way to install and run the control plane, 
data plane and UI in your account so that they can use Tembo Cloud in a 
way that meets your security requirements. 

Extension management could be a challenge here. You may not be able to use the 
public Trunk registry, so we may need to provide a way for you to use your 
own private extension registry.
