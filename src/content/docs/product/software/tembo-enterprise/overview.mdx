## Tembo Enterprise

Tembo Enterprise is a self-hosted version of the Tembo Platform that runs in your own Kubernetes cluster. It
allows you to benefit from the same features as Tembo Cloud, but with the added control and security of running
the software in your own environment.

Tembo Enterprise is made up of the same components as Tembo Cloud, but packaged and distributed in a way that allows for
easy installation and management. Instead of running in separate Kubernetes clusters, the components run in a single
Kubernetes cluster. This keeps your total cost of ownership low and makes for a simple and easy-to-manage deployment.

Configurability is a key feature of Tembo Enterprise. The platform comes with a set of default configurations and
components for convenience, but you can easily customize the platform to suit your needs. Example configurations
include:
- Enabling a private extension registry
- Using your authentication provider of choice
- Using your existing ingress, monitoring, and logging solutions

## Installation


## Releases and Upgrades

Using our Tembo Enterprise, both the control plane and the data plane are 
owned and managed by you, and will live in your cloud account. 

We'll provide you with a way to install and run the control plane, 
data plane and UI in your account so that they can use Tembo Cloud in a 
way that meets your security requirements. 

Extension management is a key feature of the Tembo experience, and the platform 
makes use of the Trunk extension registry under the hood. You may not be able to 
use the public Trunk registry, so we'll provide a way for you to use your 
own private extension registry.
