## Tembo Enterprise

Tembo Enterprise is a self-hosted version of the Tembo Platform that runs in your own Kubernetes cluster. It
allows you to benefit from the same features as Tembo Cloud, but with the added control and security of running
the software in your own environment.

Tembo Enterprise is made up of the same components as Tembo Cloud, but packaged and distributed in a way that allows for
easy installation and management. Instead of running in separate Kubernetes clusters, the components run in a single
Kubernetes cluster. This keeps your total cost of ownership low and makes for a simple and easy-to-manage deployment.

Configurability is a key feature of Tembo Enterprise. The platform comes with a set of default configurations and
components for convenience, but you can easily customize the platform to suit your needs. Example configurations
include:
- Enabling a private extension registry
- Using your authentication provider of choice
- Using your existing ingress, monitoring, and logging solutions


## Installation

Tembo Enterprise is packaged and distributed as a Helm chart. The chart can be configured to suit your needs and installed
in your Kubernetes cluster using the Helm package manager. The installation process is simple and can be done in a few
steps.
1. `helm repo add tembo https://tembo-io.github.io/tembo-enterprise`
2. `helm install tembo-enterprise tembo/tembo-enterprise`


## Releases and Upgrades
Tembo Enterprise will be released on a regular basis, with new features, bug fixes, and security updates:
- Patch releases with bugfixes every 2 weeks
- Minor releases every 3 months
- Major releases every 12 months

Upgrading Tembo Enterprise is as simple as running `helm upgrade` with the new version of the Helm chart. The upgrade
process is designed to be seamless and non-disruptive to your running workloads.
