## API

You can pause instances with the [Tembo Cloud API](/docs/development/api), using the [Lifecycle Events endpoint](https://api.tembo.io/redoc#tag/instance/operation/instance_event).

The instance states associated with pausing and resuming are known in the Tembo API as `Stopping`, `Stopped`, and `Starting`.
