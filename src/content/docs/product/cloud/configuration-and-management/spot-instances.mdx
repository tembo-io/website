## What is Spot?

[Spot](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) feature that offers discounted [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instances for fault-tolerant workloads. Amazon will provide the user with an EC2 server, but may reclaim the server with two minutes of warning. This means any workload running on a Spot server might get moved to a different server with only two minutes of warning from AWS.

## How does this work on Tembo Cloud?

[Tembo Cloud](https://cloud.tembo.io) offers the Spot option for running at a cheaper cost. Tembo charges 30% less for CPU and Memory on instances with Spot enabled. If Spot instances are not available from AWS, Tembo will automatically move your servers with Spot enabled to an on-demand EC2 instance with no additional charge.

[Tembo Apps](/docs/product/cloud/apps/rest-api) associated with your instance will also run on Spot when Spot is enabled.

The downtime associated with a Spot relocation is typically less than 10 minutes, usually 3-5 minutes when [High Availability](/docs/product/cloud/configuration-and-management/high-availability) is disabled.
