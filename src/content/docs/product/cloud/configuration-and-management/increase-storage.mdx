Find in **Settings > Instance Settings**

<Callout variant='warning'>
	Tembo Cloud does not currently support decreasing storage, which is a [limitation of our block storage provider](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/ebs-increase-decrease-volume-size).
</Callout>

Changes will only take effect after clicking **Save**. Increasing storage does not restart your database.
