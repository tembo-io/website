### Checking if you can reach the Tembo Platform

-   Can you get 404 from your domain name?
    -   Just type the domain into browser or use curl
    -   For example: `org-your-org-name-inst-your-cluster-name.data-1.use1.tembo.io`
    -   If you get a 404, then you have network connectivity to Tembo

### Tembo requires PostgreSQL clients that support Server Name Indication (SNI)

<Callout variant='info'>
    SNI issues are resolved by using an up-to-date version of the client library.
</Callout>

[Server Name Indication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) was introduced in Postgres version 14, and this feature is used in Tembo to route requests to the appropriate databases. Please review the [Postgres release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.0/) for details.

Often upgrading your dependency's version will resolve this issue. Sometimes, a Postgres client will use the underlying system's `libpq`, in which case this needs to be updated.

Here's an example of how you would install an updated PostgreSQL client on a Debian-based Linux system:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y lsb-release
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
wget -qO- https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/pgdg.asc &>/dev/null
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-client
```

Here's an example of updating `psql` and `libpq` on a Mac, using [brew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew reinstall libpq
```

Tembo aims to have a simple connection guide for any client language, so please reach out to support if you don't see your language in [this list of guides](https://tembo.io/docs/getting-started/quickstarts/nodejs).

If you want to check if you can connect to Tembo using a known, working version of a client, please use the following command. Replace the connection string with your connection string, found in the Tembo UI.

```bash
 docker run -it --rm \
    --entrypoint=psql postgres:15 \
    'postgresql://postgres:***@***.data-1.use1.tembo.io:5432'
```

If the above fails, you may be having problems reaching your cluster. Please check the previous section, or reach out to Tembo support.


## Certificate validation

<Callout variant='info'>
    Certificate validation issues are resolved with the `sslrootcert` configuration option, which may be named differently in each client.
</Callout>

Tembo uses self-signed certificates for databases.

Most Postgres clients by default do not verify the server's identity using TLS, using [sslmode=default](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html). It's better practice to connect with [sslmode=verify-ca](/docs/product/cloud/security/sslmode), especially when connecting over an untrusted network.

Some clients, for example [Node](/docs/getting-started/quickstarts/nodejs), by default require certificate validation, checking against your system's trust store, similar to how it works with HTTPS in the browser. In these cases, connection issues can be resolved by specifying a value for the configuration option `sslrootcert`, which may be named differently in each client language.

Tembo aims to have a simple connection guide for any client language, so please reach out to support if you don't see your language in [this list of guides](https://tembo.io/docs/getting-started/quickstarts/nodejs).

## Connecting with Unix domain sockets

Some extensions connect to the database using local access. This type of connection is known as an Unix domain socket connection.

```
local all all peer
```

Unix domain socket files are not in the default path on Tembo Cloud. Instead, the files are located in the directory `/controller/run`, which can be found by the configuration `unix_socket_directories`.

If you are using an extension which requires local access, you must configure this option. When connecting to Postgres, the `host` option is understood as a path to the Unix domain socket when it starts with a slash.

For example, in the case of **cron**, the configuration `cron.host` can be set to `/controller/run`. In the case of **dblink**, you can connect with: `dblink('dbname=sample host=/controller/run', 'SELECT 1')`
