import Callout from '../../../../../components/Callout.astro';

Users can issue long-lived tokens, as described in the [API documentation](/docs/development/api).

To invalidate a token, call the [API endpoint](https://api.tembo.io/swagger-ui/#/tokens/invalidate_token) for deleting tokens using that token as the authorization header.

<Callout variant='info'>
	It takes up to a minute for an invalidated token to start getting rejected by the API.
</Callout>

```bash
export TEMBO_TOKEN="The token you want to invalidate"

curl -X DELETE \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TEMBO_TOKEN}" \
    "https://api.tembo.io/api/v1/tokens/invalidate"
```
