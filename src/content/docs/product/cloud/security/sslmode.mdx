## sslmode

Postgres has a connection setting called [sslmode](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html).

Tembo Cloud supports sslmodes `require`, `verify-ca`, and `verify-full`. All of these options require encryption. The modes `verify-ca` and `verify-full` validate the server certificate using a locally provided certificate. For more information, please review the [security documentation](/docs/product/cloud/security/tenant-issolation).

## Connecting with certificate validation

The root CA certificate, know as `sslrootcert` in the [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html), can be used to authenticate the server when connecting to Postgres.
It is more secure to connect to Postgres with certificate validation, using **sslmode** `verify-ca` or `verify-full`.

To use one of these options, the Postgres client needs to be configured to use the `sslrootcert` to authenticate the Postgres server. Users can download the root certificate using the the cloud ui or via the Tembo API.
Both modes `verify-ca` or `verify-full` will authenticate the server, checking that the server's certificate was signed by the `sslrootcert`. `verify-full` also checks that the hostname on the certificate matches the domain name used to connect, therefore `verify-full` does not work with the [custom domains](/docs/product/cloud/configuration-and-management/custom-domains) feature.

### Downloading the root certificate

<Callout variant='info'>
	The root CA certificate, know as the `sslrootcert` in the [Postgres
	documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html), is
	the same between all Tembo instances.
</Callout>

-   Visit [Tembo Cloud](https://cloud.tembo.io)
-   Navigate to your desired instance
-   Click "Show connection strings" on the right side of the screen
-   Download the root certificate using the button below:

<Callout variant='warning'>
	Re-download the certificate at least monthly to avoid your copy of the
	certificate expiring

### Downloading the root certificate via the Tembo API

For information on authenticating to the API, please see the [Tembo Cloud API authentication guide](/docs/development/api).

```bash
ORG_ID='org_id123456'
INST_ID='inst_id123456'
JWT="****"

secret_name="certificate"

curl -s -X 'GET' \
  "https://api.data-1.use1.tembo.io/api/v1/orgs/${ORG_ID}/instances/${INST_ID}/secrets/${secret_name}" \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  | jq -r '."ca.crt"' > ca.crt

psql 'postgresql://postgres:****@org-name-inst-name.data-1.use1.tembo.io:5432?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=ca.crt'
```

Different clients may connect in different ways. Connection examples are available in [this section of the Tembo documentation](/docs/getting-started/quickstarts/java).
