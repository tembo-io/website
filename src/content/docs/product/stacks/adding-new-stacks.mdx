# Building Tembo Stacks

# Introduction

What are Stacks? Start here: [https://tembo.io/blog/tembo-stacks-intro](https://tembo.io/blog/tembo-stacks-intro).  Stacks are ‚Äúblueprints‚Äù for deploying PostgreSQL, extensions, tools, configurations, and anything else related to making a database fit a specific use case better. The generic Stack specification lives in code and is [enforced by a Rust Struct](https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/blob/cd8a139ef339ac4a5c61f4f513c9e7e275a15dad/tembo-operator/src/stacks/types.rs#L15-L47). The Stack Spec defines everything that should be created or configured for a given Tembo instance. All Stacks are defined in YAML. See the [stack spec files](https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/tree/cd8a139ef339ac4a5c61f4f513c9e7e275a15dad/tembo-stacks/src/stacks/specs) in the tembo repo for current examples of all existing Stacks. To build a new Stack, you must define it in YAML.

# Prerequisite knowledge

  - YAML - [https://yaml.org/](https://yaml.org/)
  - Containers, Images, and Kubernetes - [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/)
  - Postgres - configuration, extensions
  - Trunk - packages vs extensions, and versions
  - Rust types - structs, enums
  - [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/) - only if you want to define custom metrics

# Building the Stack definition

The best way to start building a new stack is to start with an [existing Stack definition](https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/blob/cd8a139ef339ac4a5c61f4f513c9e7e275a15dad/tembo-stacks/src/stacks/specs/standard.yaml).

Copy the existing stack into a new file, e.g. `my_stack.yaml`.

Then, go through each attribute and update it such that it fulfills the requirements of your Stack.

## Choose a name

Stack names must be globally unique within Tembo.

```yaml
name: MyStack
```

## Specify container image

Tembo supports stacks based on the current PostgreSQL version and two trailing ones. At the time of writing, this means PostgreSQL 16, 15, and 14, which are configured like so:

```yaml
repository: "quay.io/tembo"
images:
  14: "standard-cnpg:14-ed6e9e9"
  15: "standard-cnpg:15-ed6e9e9"
  16: "standard-cnpg:16-ed6e9e9"
```

## Define compute templates

These are recommended CPU/memory combinations for the stack's workload and influence what options the user will see when instantiating a stack through the Tembo Cloud UI.

```yaml
compute_templates:
  - cpu: 1
    memory: 4Gi
    instance_class: GeneralPurpose
  - cpu: 2
    memory: 8Gi
    instance_class: GeneralPurpose
  - cpu: 1
    memory: 2Gi
    instance_class: ComputeOptimized
  - cpu: 2
    memory: 4Gi
    instance_class: ComputeOptimized
```

## Extensions

Two sections of configuration affect extension behavior: one specifies which are to be installed to the system itself (using `trunk`) and the other specifies which are to be created (using `CREATE EXTENSION`) once the database starts.

### Installation

Consulte [pgt.dev](https://pgt.dev) for the current list of available extensions and versions. Specifying extensions to install after that is relatively straightforward:

```yaml
trunk_installs:
  - name: pgmq
    version: 1.1.1
  - name: pg_partman
    version: 4.7.4
```

### Creation

Set their version, and which database to create them in.

```yaml
extensions:
  - name: pgmq
    locations:
      - database: postgres
        enabled: true
        version: 1.1.1
  - name: pg_partman
    locations:
      - database: postgres
        enabled: true
        version: 4.7.4
```

<aside>
üí° Note, extension names can differ from their project name in pgt.dev
</aside>

## Set the configuration engine

Tembo's "PostgreSQL Configuration Engines"  are designed to dynamically calculate and set certain PostgreSQL configuration values based on:

- system infrastructure values such as CPU, memory, storage
- other PostgreSQL config values, e.g. ‚Äúhalf of `max_connections`‚Äù

For example, an engine could derive `work_mem` based on number of connections, and `shared_buffers` based on total memory. See the standard config engine [here](https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/blob/cd8a139ef339ac4a5c61f4f513c9e7e275a15dad/tembo-operator/src/stacks/config_engines.rs#L25-L72) for details on how it works.

Presently there are only two options:`standard` and `olap`

```yaml
postgres_config_engine: standard
```

## Set static config values

For example, these are postgresql.conf values that are static. They can, however, be overridden by the user. Be sure to include your extensions in the list of `shared_preload_libraries` if their documentation mentions this requirement.

```yaml
postgres_config:
  - name: shared_preload_libraries
    value: pg_stat_statements,pg_partman_bgw
  - name: pg_partman_bgw.dbname
    value: postgres
  - name: pg_partman_bgw.interval
    value: 60
  - name: pg_partman_bgw.role
    value: postgres
  - name: random_page_cost
    value: 1.1
  - name: autovacuum_naptime
    value: '20s'
  - name: autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit
    value: 10000
  - name: autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor
    value: 0.05
  - name: autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor
    value: 0.05
  - name: autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor
    value: 0.05
  - name: track_io_timing
    value: 'on'
  - name: checkpoint_timeout
    value: 10min
  - name: pg_stat_statements.track
    value: all
```

## Define containers to run next to PostgreSQL

App Services are containers that deploy alongside the primary PostgreSQL container in a stack. There are few restrictions on the types of things an App Service can do: so long as the container can be found during deployment, it can be deployed in a stack. The `AppService` spec lives [here](https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/blob/cd8a139ef339ac4a5c61f4f513c9e7e275a15dad/tembo-operator/src/app_service/types.rs#L90-L132).

### `name`

The name must be unique per Tembo instance, but is only limited by Kubernetes naming conventions.

### `image`

Container image name. This could be any image available in public container registries such as but not limited to quay.io, Docker Hub, or [ghcr.io](http://ghcr.io/).

More info: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images)

```yaml
image: postgrest/postgrest:v10.0.0
```

### `command`

A list of arguments needed to start the main command within the container. The container image's `ENTRYPOINT` is used if this is not provided. Variable references with the syntax `$(VAR_NAME)` are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double dollar signs (`$$`) are reduced to a single `$`, which allows for escaping the `$(VAR_NAME)` syntax, i.e. `"$$(VAR_NAME)"` will produce the string literal `"$(VAR_NAME)"`. Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable exists or not. See the relevant [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell) for more detail.

```yaml
command:
 - python
 - -m
 - run.py
```

### `args`

Arguments passed to the container's main command. The container image's `CMD` is used if this is not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. Variable interpolation rules are the same as with `command`.

### `env`

Environment variables to inject into the container. The tembo operator will inject postgres connection strings (read only or a read write connection) into the container if it is configured to do so.

```yaml
env:
- name: MY_ENV_VAR
  value: "my_value"
- name: VAR_DERIVED_FROM_PLATFORM
  valueFromPlatform: ReadOnlyConnection|ReadWriteConnection
```

### `resources`

Compute Resources required by this container. See the relevant [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) for more information.

```yaml
resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 256Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 400m
        memory: 256Mi
```

### `probes`

Configuration which tells kubernetes how to check in on the status of the container, i.e. how to verify that the container has started and is in a state of good health?

```yaml
probs:
/// Periodic probe of container service readiness. Container will be removed from service endpoints if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes
	readiness:
		path: /health/ready
		port: 3000
		initial_delay_seconds: 2
/// Periodic probe of container liveness. Container will be restarted if the probe fails. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes
	liveness:
		path: /health/ready
		port: 3000
		initial_delay_seconds: 2
```

### `middlewares`

Middlewares configure how incoming requests should be mutated before reaching the container specified by this App Service. Middlewares are specific to one Tembo instance. They are defined under this attribute, but used under the  `routing` section of `appServices.`

Middlewares are enums, meaning there are only specific values or types of middlewares that are supported. Currently those are `customRequestHeaders`, `stripPrefix`, and `replacePathRegex`. See [Traefik's documentation](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/overview/#http-middlewares) for more information.

```yaml
middlewares:
  - !customRequestHeaders
      name: headers
      config:
        Authorization: ""
        Content-Profile: pgmq
        Accept-Profile: pgmq
  - !stripPrefix
      name: strip-prefix
      config:
        - /rest/v1
  - !replacePathRegex
      name: map-pgmq
      config:
        regex: \/pgmq\/v1\/?
        replacement: /rpc/
```

### `routing`

Routing describes how the container should be exposed outside of the Kubernetes cluster.

In the example below, are telling Traefik to match requests on the path ‚Äú/pgmq/v1‚Äù and to route them to port 3000 on the container. Before the requests reach the container, Traefik will apply the `map-pgmq`, `strip-prefix`, and `headers` ‚ÄùMiddlewares‚Äù to the request, which are defined in the `middlewares` section of the appService spec.

```yaml
routing:
  - port: 3000
    ingressPath: /pgmq/v1
    middlewares:
      - map-pgmq
      - strip-prefix
      - headers
```

## Complete Spec

You will end up with something like this:

```yaml
name: MessageQueue
description: A Tembo Postgres Stack optimized for Message Queue workloads.
repository: "quay.io/tembo"
image: "standard-cnpg:15.3.0-1-1096aeb"

# Running and Testing a Stack

- Manually translate the Stack template onto the CoreDBSpec resource spec. See [yaml/sample-message-queue.yaml](https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo-stacks/blob/main/tembo-operator/yaml/sample-message-queue.yaml) for an example of the [MQ Stack](https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo-stacks/blob/main/tembo-operator/src/stacks/templates/message_queue.yaml) mapped to a CoreDB resource. Name it `my_coredb.yaml` or something else that makes sense.
- Follow the [Run Tembo Locally](https://tembo.io/docs/tembo-stacks/local-tembo-operator) guide to get tembo set up locally.
- Install your Tembo Stack into the local kubernetes cluster `kubectl apply -f </path/to/my_coredb.yaml`/>

# Releasing on Tembo Cloud

If creating a new Stack, follow steps 1, 2 and 3. Updates to existing stacks require steps 1 and 2.

1. Open PR on the tembo repo, in tembo-operator f
    1. this commits the Stack‚Äôs definition to the [tembo-stacks project](https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/tree/main/tembo-stacks/src/stacks/specs)
    2. Bump version to the [tembo-stacks crate](https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/blob/cbe3ddf14e4682007428532fa28bf3249c72003f/tembo-stacks/Cargo.toml#L4)
    3. Example: https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/pull/449: note-the code for tembo stacks has moved from `tembo-operator` to `tembo-stacks`. The code changes in this PR still apply, but their location has changed.
2. Open PR on the control-plane
    1. Example: https://github.com/tembo-io/control-plane/pull/399
    2. control-plane imports the `tembo_stacks` crate which contains the Stack‚Äôs specification
    3. exposes the Stack definition on the public facing platform API
3. PR to Mahout - these should not merge until PR 2 makes it to production
    1. example: https://github.com/tembo-io/mahout/pull/508
    2. this adds the data required to display the stack in the UI
    3. Optionally - release behind a feature flag (see @Darren Baldwin for feature flagging)
