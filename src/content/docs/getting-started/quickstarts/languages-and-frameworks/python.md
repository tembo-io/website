Itâ€™s important to use `psycopg2-binary` version 2.9 or greater.


## psycopg2

```shell
pip install psycopg2-binary==2.9
```


**main.py**
```python
import psycopg2

def main():
    # Connection string
    conn_str = 'postgresql://postgres:******@your-subdomain-here.data-1.use1.tembo.io:5432?sslmode=require'

    try:
        # Create a new database session
        conn = psycopg2.connect(conn_str)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unable to connect to the database: {e}")

    try:
        # Create a new cursor object.
        cur = conn.cursor()

        # Test Query
        cur.execute("SELECT 1")

        # Fetch result
        output = cur.fetchone()[0]
        print(output)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    finally:
        # Close communication with the database
        cur.close()
        conn.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

It also works without the `-binary` version of the module if the underlying `libpq` is up to date. Please see [our libpq guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstarts/database-clients-and-tools/libpq) to update your version of **libpq**.

## psycopg

If you're using Psycopg 3, which is the module named `psycopg`, then you may choose to install the version that includes the packaged dependencies like this `pip install "psycopg[binary,pool]"`, similar to the case of Psycopg 2.

It also works without the `-binary` version of the module if the underlying `libpq` is up to date. Please see [our libpq guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstarts/database-clients-and-tools/libpq) to update your version of **libpq**.
