title: How to Create Views in PostgreSQL
---

Imagine you're responsible for managing user data for your product, including their ID, name, and age. You have been asked to produce a report with a list of users older than 18; however the consumers of that view may not be allowed to see PII, like user names. You can create a view to provide them that limited access.

In PostgreSQL, views are virtual representations of data that show the outcomes of a `SELECT` query. They are like a virtual table. Views can help to reduce the complexity of queries, and improve the query reusability. They are also useful to present a limited view of data to users with fewer access privileges.

**Step 1** - Open your terminal and connect it to your desired Postgres database. Check out our [guide](https://tembo.io/docs/postgres_guides/how-to-connect-to-postgres/) to follow the step-by-step procedure.

**Step 2** - Create the SQL query that you want to turn into a view. Any `SELECT` query can be turned into a view. For example:

```sql
SELECT id, age
FROM users
WHERE age >= 18;
```

**Step 3** - If you are satisfied, you can create a view using the `CREATE VIEW` command. Assign a name to the view and add your desired query to the view:

```sql
CREATE VIEW adult_users AS
SELECT id, age
FROM users
WHERE age >= 18;
```

**Step 4** - Now you can query that view the same way you would query any table. For example:

```sql
SELECT age, COUNT(*) FROM adult_users GROUP BY age;
```

Note that views do not store any data by themselves. They are only a query over one or more tables in a database.

Postgres comes with the `ALTER VIEW` command which can be used to modify or edit the created view. `ALTER VIEW` can also be used to recreate the view with a whole new SQL query:

```sql
ALTER VIEW adult_users AS
SELECT id, age
FROM users
WHERE age >= 20;
```

And to drop (delete) the view, thereâ€™s a `DROP VIEW` command in Postgres:

```sql
DROP VIEW adult_users;
```
