There are several benefits to running your databases on a fully-managed database platform like Tembo Cloud. You don’t
have to manage the infrastructure, your provider can optimize the database and its operations, and you reduce the amount
of time and resources you need to spend to run your databases. While this works for a large number of users, many still
prefer to run databases in an environment they control. This could be due to security and compliance requirements,
control over the infrastructure, predictable costs, or the ability to debug low level issues on their own.

At Tembo, we want to enable _every_ Postgres user to use the extended Postgres ecosystem to its fullest. With that goal
in mind, we are excited to announce Tembo Self Hosted, a new product that brings the full power of Tembo Cloud to your
Kubernetes cluster. Tembo Self Hosted allows you to easily spin up 'flavored' PostgreSQL instances across multiple
versions using its intuitive UI, API and CLI. This allows you to configure, scale and monitor Postgres instances with
access to 200+ extensions and 10+ Stacks and Apps. All this with flexibility and full control over:
- Infrastructure and Application Configuration
- Cloud / Kubernetes Provider
- Cloud Region
- Standards Adherence
- Compliance and Network Security

In other words, it's now possible to run the Tembo Platform anywhere you have a Kubernetes cluster!

## What's Included?

### Tembo Self Hosted Architecture

## Deploy Tembo As You Choose

### Highly Configurable

### Use the Cloud Provider of Your Choice
While deployments on Tembo Cloud have multi-vendor selection on its roadmap, Tembo Self Hosted can be used on any cloud
service that supports Kubernetes. This means if you prefer a certain cloud vendor, but Tembo Cloud doesn’t support it at
this time, you can self-deploy Tembo Self Hosted! This extends both to major and minor cloud providers, as long as they
provide Kubernetes as a service.

### Your Region, Your Standards
Standards and compliance are critical for any production-grade operation. While many of these standards are related to
the technology itself, often the discussion of geographic placement comes to light. Tembo Self Hosted is flexible in the
region in which it is deployed, offering data residency requirements.

### Dedicated Support When You Need It
As part of Self Hosted, users gain access to a dedicated support plan, which is prioritized according to case severity.
This includes 24/7 coverage on the highest priority items to make sure you and your team have support when it's needed
most.
