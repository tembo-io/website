At Tembo we’re very invested in open source. We built with, and on top of open source, and we release extensions and tooling for others to use as they wish. Occasionally we’ll receive feature requests for projects we’ve developed, and we have ideas for these projects as well. Unfortunately there are only so many hours in the day. And some ideas need specialized skills. 

That’s where we hope to lean on the community, but not without offering something in return.

[Algora](https://algora.io) is a platform around code bounties. They publish open source projects looking for contributions and their community picks up challenges for a cash reward. At the time of writing Algora awarded 2,177 bounties totaling $267,962.00 to 497 contributors. We decided to partner with Algora to get external feedback on some of the projects we’re working on.

## About the projects

We selected 2 projects that we think are very fit for external contributions.

1. [pgmq](https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq ) - A lightweight message queue. Like AWS SQS and RSMQ but on Postgres. 
2. [pg_vectorize](https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_vectorize) - A Postgres extension that automates the transformation and orchestration of text to embeddings and provides hooks into the most popular LLMs.
