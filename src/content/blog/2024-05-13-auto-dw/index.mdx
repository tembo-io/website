[pg_auto_dw](https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_auto_dw) is a new open source project, an auto-data warehouse extension that uses LLM to inspect operational Postgres schemas, and sets up automation to create a well-formed data warehouse. 

Whether it's Data Vault, Kimball format, etc I don't care - I just want something better than a dumb dev like me would build as a DW - a pile of ingested tables, and ad-hoc derivative tables. 

I have wanted this badly for years as a dev + data engineer. We aren't sure how this experiment will work out, but kind of fun to start something without certainty of success. 

We've recently partnered with our friend Johnathan Pickard from [Analyzer1](https://www.analyzer1.com/) to iterate with us on this project. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), he will transition his previously built automations to be as fully-automated as possible.

## Why Postgres for Data Warehouse Automations?  

We do not believe that automating the creation of data warehousing structures should be offloaded and partitioned at the analytic edge.  Classically, operational data is offloaded at interval to be processed by a dedicated data team. 

This approach has several disadvantages. Firstly, it makes operational analytics an afterthought or at least an expensive and time consuming endeavor.  Secondly, it creates a very broad data sprawl which directly conflicts with the paradigm of a unified data model.  

PostgreSQL stands as the world's most popular, comprehensive, and extensible open-source database, with its growing trend reinforcing its future-proof status.

## Join us on the Journey

We are just getting started. The development process is transparent and [open for everyone to see on GitHub](https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_auto_dw). 

We invite developers, data scientists, and technology enthusiasts to join us. Your insights and contributions are invaluable as we push the boundaries of what is possible.

Stay tuned for upcoming product demos and development blogs related to building and using this extension.
