Following customer demand you can now deploy Instances to different Regions in [Tembo Cloud](https://cloud.tembo.io/). This of course is to reduce latency, to keep your data close to where you do your compute, but also because you might have requirements around data residency. 

We currently support US East 1 (N Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore) and Europe (Frankfurt), and plan to support all AWS Regions in time. 

## Deploying to Regions

When creating an Instance, pick a Region using the drop-down selector.

After deploying an Instance, the Region cannot be changed.

### API
When using the [Tembo API](https://github.com/tembo-io/website/blob/725f4104f33f45fd18fb395a3a0b16fc4f4fedf2/docs/development/api), Providers and Regions are represented as Dataplanes. Dataplanes are where Instances are hosted. A Dataplane is uniquely identified by `provider_id`, `region_id`, and `index`.
Here is a sample of a Dataplane returned by the Tembo Cloud API. 
```
 {
    "index": "data-1",
    "provider_id": "aws",
    "provider_name": "AWS",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "region_id": "use1",
    "region_name": "US East 1 (N. Virginia)"
  }
```

When you create an Instance, you may specify the Provider and Region using `provider_id` and `region_id`. Tembo decides which index to deploy your Instance into. By default, instances are deployed to `aws`, `use1`.

Some queries to Tembo's APIs involve fetching private data from your Instance, for example [Logs](https://github.com/tembo-io/website/blob/725f4104f33f45fd18fb395a3a0b16fc4f4fedf2/docs/product/cloud/troubleshooting/logs), [Metrics](https://github.com/tembo-io/website/blob/725f4104f33f45fd18fb395a3a0b16fc4f4fedf2/docs/product/cloud/troubleshooting/metrics), and [Secrets](https://github.com/tembo-io/website/blob/725f4104f33f45fd18fb395a3a0b16fc4f4fedf2/docs/product/cloud/security/update-postgres-password). These queries go to the [Dataplane API](https://api.data-1.use1.tembo.io/redoc), which has a different domain name for each Dataplane. This model allows for more secure handling of sensitive information.
Dataplane API domain names are structured like this: `api.< index >.< region_id >.tembo.io`, for example api.data-1.use1.tembo.io. 

For more information, please check the [interactive API documentation](https://api.tembo.io/swagger-ui/#/dataplane/get_all_dataplanes).

## What’s next?

When providers other than AWS are supported, we will include the `provider_id` in the domain name for Providers other than AWS. Supporting other clouds is on our immediate roadmap. 

Tembo Self Hosted on Azure - or: on AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) - is also coming. [Tembo Self Hosted on AWS](https://tembo.io/blog/tembo-self-hosted) is already available for you today, bringing the full power of Tembo Cloud to your Kubernetes cluster. We’ll focus on adding GCP (Google Cloud Platform) next.
