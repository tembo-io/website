Here's our thought process: When a user is in our Cloud UI they might need to look up a thing they’re trying to accomplish. Rather than assuming they always have our Docs open in a second window, we wanted to offer search functionality to query our Docs and website straight from [cloud.tembo.io](https://cloud.tembo.io/). This blog will teach you how to achieve the same feature for your products the Tembo way: building on top of Postgres. 

## Building AI-powered Search

Our Search is underpinned by the search and command widget tool [cmdk](https://github.com/pacocoursey/cmdk), fuzzy-search library [fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/), and vector search. We use vector search for the Docs, dogfooding our [pgvectorize extension](https://pgt.dev/extensions/vectorize), embeddings and [pgvector](https://pgt.dev/extensions/pgvector).
We’ve also introduced an AI agent for more complex queries. _Ask Tembo_ uses 2 custom [Tembo Apps](https://tembo.io/docs/product/cloud/apps/overview), deployed and hosted on Tembo Cloud. It uses a LLM hosted on Tembo. If you do a search in the Cloud UI, you're logged in and we understand your context, your results are bound to be most relevant.

“In the olden days” we used Algolia for Docs search, but unsatisfied with the results we wanted to try and roll our own. We are considering releasing our setup as an open source Postgres-powered alternative. Let us know if that’s something you’d be interested in trying out for your product by voting for the feature on our [roadmap](https://roadmap.tembo.io/roadmap).

Search within Tembo Cloud now looks like so:

And toggling _Ask Tembo_ to ask your question:

## What’s next?

We’ll include search functionality for [our blog](https://tembo.io/blog) soon, but today blog results already show up in _Ask Tembo_.

In terms of further improvement we want to offer suggestions for queries (FAQs), and show users their recent search queries. We’re also thinking of introducing a feedback mechanism if the selection doesn't match what you were looking for. In any case you can rest assured that we'll share the instructions so you can add similar functionality to your applications.

As always, we love to hear from you about functionality that will make your life easier. Please suggest and upvote features on our [roadmap](https://roadmap.tembo.io/roadmap)!
