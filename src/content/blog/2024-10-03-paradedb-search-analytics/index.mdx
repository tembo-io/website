We're excited to announce the launch of two new Tembo stacks, powered by ParadeDB.

- The ParadeDB Stack — Designed as a search stack, it is powered by the ParadeDB extensions and is designed as an Elasticsearch alternative for customers needing high-quality full-text search over Postgres data.
- The Analytics Stack — Designed as a data lake stack, it is powered by the ParadeDB pg_analytics DuckDB-in-Postgres extension and is designed for high-performance analytics over object storages like S3 and table formats like Iceberg.

## What is ParadeDB?

[ParadeDB](https://www.paradedb.com/) is an Elasticsearch alternative built on Postgres. ParadeDB is built as two extensions, pg_search and pg_analytics, which together bring fast full-text search and high-performance analytics to Postgres.

## Why we're partnering?

Tembo is on a mission to enable developers to do more (dare we say, everything?) on Postgres. Adding different technology to your stack to handle specific use cases introduces complexity and costs. We haven’t met a problem yet that Postgres couldn’t solve.

[ParadeDB is one of the fastest-growing open source database projects on GitHub](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb), with over 50,000 deployments. Their extensions are deployed with some of the largest organizations in the world powering production workloads at scale.

Our teams share a joint vision for the future of the Postgres ecosystem and we couldn't imagine a better partnership than to combine the Tembo Cloud platform and our operational expertise with ParadeDB's feature rich extensions. Our joint customers will now be able to access a fully hosted version of ParadeDB directly on the Tembo platform.

## Getting started?

Log into [cloud.tembo.io](https://cloud.tembo.io/) and select either the ParadeDB or the Analytics stack to get started. These stacks are not available to Hobby Tiers. Check out our Docs for a [quickstart]().
