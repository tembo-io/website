We at Tembo are proud to announce the launch of [Tembo University](/university/). It's a place to learn about Postgres, experiment with its vast ecosystem of tools, and build a few things along the way. It's intended for amateurs and experts alike, meant to foster collaboration and curiosity among prospective students of all skill levels.

We want to help bring your Postgres knowledge to the next level while ensuring those lessons are useful within the real world. How do we intend to do that? Allow us to explain.

## A place of learning

What kind of mental picture comes to mind when you think of a university? Is it stadium seating in lecture halls? Rows of machines in a computer lab, ready for collaboration in the next group project? Is it the buildings themselves, mixtures of architecture both demonstrative of past techniques, and vastly functional in their own right? Is it the students and staff, milling about or steadfastly marching toward the next class across campus?

Here at Tembo, when we think upon the scenes a university invokes within the mind, Postgres reigns supreme. The lecture halls? Replete with classes regarding various facets of Postgres. The computer labs? Experimenting with projects on the latest Postgres release, or even an early beta. The buildings? Grand archives bursting with Postgres tomes, server auditoriums providing distributed Kubernetes Postgres clusters crammed with petabytes of research data, and more besides. The campus populated with seasoned experts excited to pass along their hard-won Postgres expertise to a fresh crop of students.

In the absence of a physical campus to breathe life into such a bustling Postgres milieu, Tembo elects to construct a wholly online analog. While there are no tangible sweeping amphitheaters or vaulted hallways, we intend to capture the ambiance they impart. It's not just a cold series of how-to articles, but an interactive world of experimentation and discovery.

## A thriving forum

The first course in the curated Tembo University curriculum is something that should be immediately useful: an URL shortener. It's a tiny fragment of a larger whole, and an adventure we intend to guide you through.

Every course chapter will provide associated code in the [Tembo University GitHub project](https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo-u) so you can follow along. Find a bug? Do you have a suggestion to improve the project? Feel free to submit a PR so everyone can benefit. This is how we intend to foster a university atmosphere: through collaboration by everyone involved, all working together to learn.

Courses alone do not a university make. In the spirit of the Postgres community and surrounding ecosystem, Tembo University will also serve as a beacon of Postgres insights as well. Our [Postgres guides](/docs/getting-started/postgres_guides) and supporting documentation will eventually move here to serve as reference material. It will be our library and gift to the Postgres community that has subsisted on loose collections of blogs for far too long.

As time moves on, the full scope of Tembo University will also evolve. Webinars and instructional videos should eventually premier. Perhaps we'll introduce an interactive chatroom with other members, including experts from Tembo itself. With enough interest, we could integrate monthly or bi-weekly forums akin to [Fireside Chats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireside_chats) to discuss all things Postgres with attendees. We intend to embrace any reasonable technique that will complete the illusion of an active and thriving university.

## Welcome to Tembo U

Ultimately, we at Tembo want what's best for Postgres. Even internally, we've dedicated ourselves to the cause:

> Our mission is to deliver the most **reliable**, **dependable**, and **_accessible_** Postgres service available to _any_ developer working to build the next Big Thing.

One aspect of that service is usability and understanding of the available tools. Our cloud GUI can accomplish some of that, but nothing is a substitute for familiarity. True understanding requires hands-on experience and experimentation. The content in Tembo University will reflect that, curated by engineers and experts in Postgres, application development, and UI, throughout our entire organization.

Should any of our past blogs be applicable, we'll adapt them into a new course. If our team learned anything while designing or building a Postgres extension like [pgmq](https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq), or working on our [Kubernetes operator](https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo), that will also make its way into the university. We believe everyone has something to contribute to this endeavor, so expect a lively gamut of Tembo (or guest?) authors.

If you or your organization wants to take the next step and work directly with a team at Tembo, our [Buildcamp](/solutions/buildcamp/) initiative does just that. We'll help you produce something useful to your enterprise, from migration and data warehousing, to LLM and AI integration, and more besides.

If not? We welcome you to enjoy all Tembo University content as presented, free of charge. We wouldn't be here without Postgres, and this is our way of giving back. If it also results in a smoother and informed developer experience for Postgres users, all the better.

Welcome to Tembo University!
