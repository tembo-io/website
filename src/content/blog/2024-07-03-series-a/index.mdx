We're excited to announce that Tembo has raised a $14M Series A round, 
to fuel our mission **to make it as easy as possible for developers 
to more easily access the entire Postgres open source ecosystem**. We 
are building an exciting alternative to existing universe of 
relatively-limited managed Postgres offerings, and an alternative to the 
growing sprawl of databases and database tools offered by the major clouds.

We are thankful to our Series A investors:

## Providing an alternative to the growing data tool sprawl

There are now hundreds of databases available in the market, in fact
[db-engines](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking) lists 421.

[![421 databases at db-engines](./421-databases.png 'db-engines')](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking)

We believe that many developers would love an open-source, 
multi-workload data platform to simplify their lives and work, 
especially if it doesn't restrict their freedom.

Organizations, meanwhile, want reliability, flexibility, and a 
options out of the spiraling costs and vendor lock-in attempts. 
We belive there's an obvious solution that ticks all the necessary 
boxes: **Postgres**.

<Callout title="Postgres is the world's favorite database" variant='info'>
  Postgres, the world's most beloved database 
  [according to StackOverflow](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/)
  with millions of deployments, 
  features a permissive OSS license, and a huge community. 
  
  It efficiently 
  manages SQL and JSON queries across diverse workloads, handles low 
  latency, high throughput analytical cases, offering HTAP-lite capabilities 
  through window functions and foreign data wrappers. Known for its 
  extensibility and ACID compliance, it stands out as a reliable and 
  cost-effective system.

  Even better, its extensibility has resulted in a wide ecosystem of 
  add-ons and plugins for GIS data, image processing, vector databases, 
  and more, with some extensions evolving into companies like CitusDB 
  and Timescale. In short, everything you'd want and then some.

## The AI/LLM explosion demands a data platform rethink

Due to the explosion of AI and its data demands,
every organization is rethinking their data platform.

So...

## Developers want to choose Postgres

They really do. Postgres grew up as a transactional database, but devs know that
it can now be used for analytical and AI workloads.

But the sad news is that for non-OLTP use cases, Postgres doesn't win many bake-offs,
vs. specialized tools. It's a shame. Nobody had been working to give developers the
product and the ammo they need to choose Postgres for all the newer data use cases.

Until now....

## One Postgres platform to rule them all

Tembo is available as a fully-managed SaaS and as self-hosted Kubernetes-based
software, providing a single unified platform that comes with unprecedented
Postgres expertise and support across a wide range of use cases.

And we've added convenience features such as:

-   200+ available Postgres extensions
-   columnar data storage
-   tiered storage
-   in-cluster embedding and LLM services
-   a lot more

This provides teams the ability to build modern data products with maximum security,
real time data access, and absolute data sovereignty.

Developers will easily be able to deploy different flavors of Postgres
to multiple clouds and regions, with advanced options such as auto-scaling,
auto-pausing, and auto-tuning under active development.

## Join the movement—some closing talking points

Our vision isn't complete, but it's compelling and includes:

-   Postgres isn't just a database; it's a powerful platform capable of anything
    from simple applications to complex data ecosystems.
-   Tembo provides a Postgres-managed service that enables organizations to
    harness the full power of the popular open-source database Postgres for
    transactional, analytical and AI workloads across any cloud, anywhere.
-   By making it easy for developers to access the entire Postgres open source
    ecosystem, we're also enabling organizations, from Fortune 500 to startups,
    to feel confident going “all in” on Postgres, achieving unprecedented stability
    and efficiency across various applications and use cases.

LFG.
