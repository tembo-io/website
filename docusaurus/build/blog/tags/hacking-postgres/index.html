I&#x27;m Rye Walker, founder of Tembo, a managed Postgres company, and today I have Phil Noel from ParadeDB, working on ParadeDB as my guest. Phil, welcome to the show.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000037---phil">[00:00:37]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000037---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000037---phil" title="Direct link to 000037---phil">â</a></h5><p>Thanks. Yeah, thanks. Nice to meet you. Thanks for having me.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000042---ry">[00:00:42]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000042---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000042---ry" title="Direct link to 000042---ry">â</a></h5><p>Great to actually meet you. I&#x27;d like to start...maybe you could give us a quick background, like maybe where&#x27;d you grow up in the world? And what were you doing before?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000053---phil">[00:00:53]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000053---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000053---phil" title="Direct link to 000053---phil">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, absolutely. Happy to. So I&#x27;m originally from Quebec City, the French part of Canada. I actually grew up in this small town called <!-- -->[inaudible 01:02]<!-- --> , which is 2 hours East. Spent most of my life there, and then eventually I left to go to university. I stayed in Boston, studied computer science and neuroscience, did a few things. I started a browser company before ParadeDB, which I ran for about three years, and then after that got acquaintance with the joys of Postgres, you could say through that experience. Sounds somewhat similar to yours, maybe, although not to the same scale. And my previous co founder and I only started ParadeDB.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000135---ry">[00:01:35]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000135---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000135---ry" title="Direct link to 000135---ry">â</a></h5><p>Nice. Tell the browser company, what was that called and how far did you get in that project?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000143---phil">[00:01:43]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000143---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000143---phil" title="Direct link to 000143---phil">â</a></h5><p>Oh, that is both a short and a long story. It was called Wisp. We were building like a cloud based web browser, so the initial idea was to offload heavy processing to the cloud by streaming, which is like an age old idea, but we were young and dumb, so we thought we had invented something. We did that for a while, raised a couple of rounds of funding, grew a team to like 25 people, but we never quite found PMF and eventually pivoted to cybersecurity. Did that for a while, but it was a much better market, but not our battle to win. So we closed down the company. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000221---ry">[00:02:21]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000221---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000221---ry" title="Direct link to 000221---ry">â</a></h5><p>Okay. I&#x27;m sure we both have a lot of battle stories we could commiserate over. Do you remember when you first started using Postgres? I can&#x27;t remember. That&#x27;s why I ask this question, because it kind of just happened at some point in my career. But do you remember specifically when you started with Postgres?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000245---phil">[00:02:45]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000245---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000245---phil" title="Direct link to 000245---phil">â</a></h5><p>I don&#x27;t know. Actually. That&#x27;s a good question. I don&#x27;t know. As a user? I don&#x27;t know. As a developer since earlier this year or last year.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000258---ry">[00:02:58]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000258---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000258---ry" title="Direct link to 000258---ry">â</a></h5><p>Well, cool. Obviously as a user, you&#x27;ve used it for years, I&#x27;m sure. Tell me about your Postgres work. What have you built in the past and what are you building now? Or is this all just the first thing?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000312---phil">[00:03:12]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000312---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000312---phil" title="Direct link to 000312---phil">â</a></h5><p>I guess I would say it&#x27;s the first major thing. So we can keep it to that, what we&#x27;re doing. So we&#x27;re building ParadeDB. ParadeDB is like a Postgres database, essentially, or Postgres extension, where we&#x27;re integrating native full text search within Postgres, which is something that some people are quick to jump to say this already exists, and some people are quick to jump to say the one that exists is very bad. And so they&#x27;re excited about what we&#x27;re doing. So it depends which camp you fall on. But the first thing we released is this extension is called pg_bm25, where we&#x27;re essentially integrating proper full text search within Postgres and then combine this with some of the existing innovations that&#x27;s come, like pgvector to build hybrid search. And our goal is to build this Postgres type database that is sort of the go to choice for companies where search is critical to the product they&#x27;re building. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000408---ry">[00:04:08]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000408---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000408---ry" title="Direct link to 000408---ry">â</a></h5><p>Nice. Why do you think you&#x27;re working on this? What led you here?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000414---phil">[00:04:14]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000414---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000414---phil" title="Direct link to 000414---phil">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s a good question, actually. This is a problem we face ourselves and that&#x27;s kind of why we wanted to solve it. So after my first company, my co founder and I, we were trying to decide what we&#x27;re going to do next. So we started doing some contracting work sort of left and right. I was living in Paris at the time and working with a lot of French and German company. And when we were working with this German automaker, they just really needed high quality full text search within Postgres. So the promo we were building for them, and instead we had to glue Elasticsearch or some vector database on top. And it was just a nightmare. And we were very frustrated how bad it was and decided, you know what, maybe we should just fix it ourselves. And so that kind of led us to today. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000500---ry">[00:05:00]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000500---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000500---ry" title="Direct link to 000500---ry">â</a></h5><p>Got it. Yeah, it&#x27;s interesting. I don&#x27;t know. There was a famous tweet that I can&#x27;t remember the exact wording on, but it basically said something to the effect that, hey, tech founders, you do yourself well to pivot to building something that would support whatever you would be building today. Basically go one level deeper than your current idea is similar to what we did at Astronomer, because we were basically building a competitor to segment clickstream data processing. And then we started using Airflow. Then we said, hey, let&#x27;s just provide airflow as a service. And kind of made that switch to go down a level and that was the winning pivot for that company. So it sounds like you&#x27;ve kind of jumped down to more of an infrastructural issue, which I think is good. Well, what challenges? Obviously there&#x27;s a lot of ground to cover, but what are your biggest challenges, would you say you face so far? Building this thing.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000612---phil">[00:06:12]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000612---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000612---phil" title="Direct link to 000612---phil">â</a></h5><p>You mean like business wise or technical wise or process wise?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000616---ry">[00:06:16]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000616---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000616---ry" title="Direct link to 000616---ry">â</a></h5><p>Actually, yeah. I&#x27;d love to hear all categories of challenge. Yeah, spill the beans. What&#x27;s hard about this? I imagine fundraise. I mean, it&#x27;s a tough time to fundraise, so that&#x27;s probably not awesome. But yeah, maybe start technically.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000633---phil">[00:06:33]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000633---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000633---phil" title="Direct link to 000633---phil">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I can start technically. I think software is the easiest part of building a company, so I would say these are our simplest set of challenges. Not to say it&#x27;s know, I was actually talking to Eric that I listened to the Hacking Postgres episode with Eric and I talked to him afterwards. At first we didn&#x27;t know pgrx was a thing, and we were like, oh my God, how on earth is this even going to be a thing? And then we found out pgrx was a thing and we&#x27;re like, wow, it went from near impossible to quite doable, really. So, like on the technical front, I mean, there&#x27;s just so much you need to do when you&#x27;re building search, right? We have covered a small ground of features of what people expect, and there are so many more that we need to build, and so we&#x27;re trying to prioritize that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000725---ry">[00:07:25]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000725---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000725---ry" title="Direct link to 000725---ry">â</a></h5><p>Obviously Elastic is probably the big competitor. Can you estimate what percentage of their functionality you aim to replace? Is it essentially 100% and what&#x27;s your progress towards that?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000741---phil">[00:07:41]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000741---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000741---phil" title="Direct link to 000741---phil">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s a good question. I mean, our progress was small. It&#x27;s small enough that you can use it, but Elastic is enormous, right? I don&#x27;t think we aim to replace or not to replace, sorry. To match 100% of their features, at least for transactional data, which is what we need today. I think we actually had a decent bit of the way done and definitely enough to keep us busy for a couple of months. But I think that&#x27;s sort of the first step of what we&#x27;re looking to match beyond that, like what everything elastic does for observability, that&#x27;s sort of another story, and that&#x27;s another milestone that we will see depending on what our customers want.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000829---ry">[00:08:29]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000829---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000829---ry" title="Direct link to 000829---ry">â</a></h5><p>Obviously I&#x27;m building a fresh new tech startup as well, and I understand you got to match the functionality of, I call it the table stakes features. But then you also have to come up with some differentiators or else no one will care. So what are the biggest differentiators you&#x27;re thinking about with ParadeDB?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000849---phil">[00:08:49]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000849---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000849---phil" title="Direct link to 000849---phil">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, so that&#x27;s a good question. I think for ParadeDB right now, the differentiator has been, ironically, I would say the combination of two non differentiated things, if that makes sense, which is like, if you want to do search over transactional data, ParadeDB is sort of the best solution today because it&#x27;s the only thing that actually truly combines the two. It wasn&#x27;t done before. And so sort of our initial interest, I would say, has come from that. So typically when people wanted to do this, they would have some managed Postgres provider, of which there are many, and then they would use Elastic and then they would need to combine the two and then run the two and so on. It can be a ton of work. And so ParadeDB sort of makes that a single system and especially for small companies, which is where you&#x27;ve been really, it&#x27;s been a lot easier to manage, I would say. And so that really draws them to us. That&#x27;s sort of like our initial point initially, but we have some other things that will be coming up which hopefully will expand on this sort of initial interest.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000952---ry">[00:09:52]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000952---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000952---ry" title="Direct link to 000952---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, it seemed to me like as I think about building my next search bar in a product, I have to decide do I want to go what I can so call like the old school way versus vector search? Maybe I can get away with some sort of AI integration for search. Are people asking that question or do they have the perception that maybe like vector search somehow gets, replaces or displaces in some way traditional full text search type features?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001028---phil">[00:10:28]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001028---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001028---phil" title="Direct link to 001028---phil">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s a very good question. A lot of people have, I&#x27;ve talked to a lot of people who weigh in on both sides of the coin. I would say my personal take is both will remain quite important just because at the end of the day people will still have data and we&#x27;ll still need to be able to find instances of those data. Right. And there&#x27;s one way to find it via similarity, but there&#x27;s also sometimes you just want to start from a clean place. And so I think both are quite valuable. Most of the people we talk to, hybrid search is very important to them, like the combination of the two, both big and small companies. And that&#x27;s one of the reasons why we built Parade the way we did today, where pgvector exists and so many others. And I would almost say vector search is kind of table stake now. We don&#x27;t really have to innovate on that so much ourselves, I would say. But the traditional search is kind of the piece that&#x27;s been missing, which is why we released this first extension, pg_bm25, and then we offered the combination of both as well <!-- -->[inaudible 11:29]<!-- -->  with another extension called pg_search, which we&#x27;re going to be publicizing more heavily soon.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001135---ry">[00:11:35]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001135---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001135---ry" title="Direct link to 001135---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think it seems like, well, it seems to me like everything has to have an AI story or else perhaps it&#x27;s been outdated. Right. So I think even search, even full tech search, you can say I like that the hybrid answer is a good answer. Obviously then you have to figure out how to hybridize it all. And that&#x27;s not necessarily trivial. But yeah, I&#x27;m curious to see what you come up with on this.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001207---phil">[00:12:07]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001207---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001207---phil" title="Direct link to 001207---phil">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, it takes some effort. It takes some effort. I would say we definitely have an AI story, but our personal take on the whole AI world and fade is like AI is sort of a step function improvement on existing things being done, but you need a foundation of value proposition for customers on the fundamental non AI part of the product, if that makes sense. And that&#x27;s kind of how we think about it. There are so many people that are trying to bring AI when there was nothing useful to begin with. Well, I really think of AI as taking something that was useful to begin with and making it that much better. And so it kind of plays quite well actually with the way we&#x27;ve been going about delivering this product and saying like, hey, we&#x27;ll just give you really good full text search and obviously so much more can be done. But if that is not useful in the first place in Postgres, then who cares that I can add AI to.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001301---ry">[00:13:01]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001301---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001301---ry" title="Direct link to 001301---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, yeah, I agree. Yeah, I think about it. Know you can&#x27;t build AI without training data, right? And you can&#x27;t, you can&#x27;t have training data without a product. You know, to collect some base level data. If you have a base level of product without AI, basically you have to start without AI, don&#x27;t have data at all. And I think that&#x27;s a challenge. A lot of founders, maybe they&#x27;re thinking they&#x27;re going to go straight to AI. They&#x27;re like, there&#x27;s nothing. You got to start basic. Yeah, I agree. What are some big milestones? How many big milestones do you have envisioned for ParadeDB at this moment?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001344---phil">[00:13:44]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001344---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001344---phil" title="Direct link to 001344---phil">â</a></h5><p>That&#x27;s also a good question.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001346---ry">[00:13:46]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001346---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001346---ry" title="Direct link to 001346---ry">â</a></h5><p>I mean you probably have a next one, right? You usually know your next big milestone.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001350---phil">[00:13:50]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001350---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001350---phil" title="Direct link to 001350---phil">â</a></h5><p>Hopefully you&#x27;d have that.

But I&#x27;m curious.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001358---phil">[00:13:58]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001358---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001358---phil" title="Direct link to 001358---phil">â</a></h5><p>Happy to share. I mean, to be honest our big milestones was to get a thousand stars in new Hub and then some stranger posted our repo on Hacker News and somehow that happened in a couple of days, which was really exciting and rather unexpected. Now our big milestone is we&#x27;re about to release our own small version of managed Postgres ish specifically for ParadeDB to test how else we can deliver value to people. Like many that have been using the product so far have been using our self hosted version, which I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re extremely familiar with how people don&#x27;t want to do this, doing Tembo. So that&#x27;s the next big milestone that&#x27;s coming, trying to learn to manage this. And then after that we have a couple of, I think after that we&#x27;ll see the exact number. We&#x27;re just trying to get more people on it and see what they think. Really.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001453---ry">[00:14:53]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001453---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001453---ry" title="Direct link to 001453---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, just grow users. This is another thing I&#x27;ve been thinking about around just even like we have stacks at Tembo with different use cases for Postgres, and then some things ought to be workloads separated from other things. Like for example, do you keep your analytical workload separate from transactional? That&#x27;s clear. But search is interesting, whether that&#x27;s like an add on. Is that just work that the transactional database should be doing, or is it somehow, do you think the workload for search should be isolated from traditional transactional workloads? From an application standpoint, that&#x27;s a good question.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001536---phil">[00:15:36]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001536---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001536---phil" title="Direct link to 001536---phil">â</a></h5><p>I think it depends what product you&#x27;re building, to be honest, because you don&#x27;t want to slow down transactions. That&#x27;s something that&#x27;s very important to us. For example, I think it&#x27;s possible to integrate it, actually. I think it&#x27;s up to you, the way we&#x27;re thinking about it. So the way we&#x27;ve built ParadeDB is we offer weak consistency over search. So what this means is the way we build searches, we have inverted indices that store the tokenized data that you want to search over, but those are weakly consistent. So just like if you use Elastic, for example, and something like Zombodb, and then you synchronize it, there will be some lag between transactions being updated in your database and eventually being reflected in your search engine, the same thing happens, but it happens automatically for ParadB, instead of being it can be minutes sometimes here will be like a few seconds at the very most, but it ensures that your transactions are never slowed down, which is quite critical for people. So I think if you build in that way, it&#x27;s actually quite possible to centralize it and have it be integrated with the actual database. If you don&#x27;t use a product where search is built that way, then I don&#x27;t think you want to slow down your transaction so you have to isolate them.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001648---ry">[00:16:48]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001648---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001648---ry" title="Direct link to 001648---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think a lot of people just obviously just do it inside their transactional database because it seems like overkill. Spin up a new Postgres, just especially like traditional shitty full tech search that&#x27;s available. But if we want to get good search, if I wanted to build really good search into an application, I would go buy Algolia or something like that. And that clearly is a microservice at that point, right? I&#x27;m sending data to them to index and they&#x27;re sending me back results really quickly that are happening. It&#x27;s not taxing my main database as a part of that. So I kind of like thinking of search as, let&#x27;s call it great search as a microservice candidate for sure, because the better you make it, the more compute it requires. The more compute it requires, the more it&#x27;s competing. Right? So I don&#x27;t know, I like the idea of just taking that worldview. That great search needs to be separated from the transactional or analytical.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001803---phil">[00:18:03]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001803---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001803---phil" title="Direct link to 001803---phil">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think you&#x27;re right in a lot of ways. You do need to be able to orchestrate it properly at scale. This is definitely something that we will ponder more and more as we have more people using it and using it at greater scale. I do think even if it needs to be solely separate from what we have done today, one of the great things and where DBMS and Postgres managed companies like ParadeDB or Tembo show up is in the ability to just make it transparent to the customer. The actual complexity of the orchestration behind the.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001837---ry">[00:18:37]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001837---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001837---ry" title="Direct link to 001837---ry">â</a></h5><p>So, you know, you&#x27;ve been writing code for a number of years now. What would you say your most important lesson has been? Kind of switching from the technical to the interpersonal or just like professional. Do you have any top lesson? If you&#x27;re going to meet with a young developer, you&#x27;d say.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001900---phil">[00:19:00]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001900---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001900---phil" title="Direct link to 001900---phil">â</a></h5><p>Specifically on writing code? Yeah, specifically on writing code. I would say only write the code that you need to write. I think that&#x27;s like a big one. Our previous company, maybe I&#x27;ll bother with this one. I like to think of products and startups now as like science experiments, as works of art. And I think our previous company, we thought of it as a work of art. So we came out of college, we were so incredibly into it and we wanted to be perfect. We cared so tremendously about what we did, that we always went above and beyond and it always made the product better and it involved writing more code, but it did not always make the product better in a way that meaningfully improved the experience of the user or brought us closer to product market fit. Right. And so I think if you think of a work of art like it&#x27;s never finished, it needs to be perfect, versus a science experiment is more like, what&#x27;s the bare minimum I can do to validate or invalidate this hypothesis I have or deliver value to a customer. And so what I would say, what I wish I could say to my younger self was, if no one has asked for this, I don&#x27;t think you need to do it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002012---ry">[00:20:12]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002012---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002012---ry" title="Direct link to 002012---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, it&#x27;s a good point. So you&#x27;re saying be more of a scientist than an artist, perhaps to some degree. When you&#x27;re starting on something and it&#x27;s not validated.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002026---phil">[00:20:26]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002026---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002026---phil" title="Direct link to 002026---phil">â</a></h5><p>I think a lot of great products are almost like work of arts. Like, people were so obsessed over it and you can feel that. And so I don&#x27;t think you want to leave all types of esthetic approach or care to it, but I think definitely early on, before you even sink so much time into it, you just want to get feedback quickly. Right. And that involves just only writing the code you need to write. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002049---ry">[00:20:49]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002049---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002049---ry" title="Direct link to 002049---ry">â</a></h5><p>I&#x27;ll tell you a quick story. Like when we started astronomer, I have a good friend, Greg Neiheisel. He was CTO and basically my partner of crime. And we just very much mind melded on a lot of things. But our attitude following your principle was really what we were building was this beautiful lattice of glue, and everything was open source inside. So we used, for example, we used Google&#x27;s material design, which had just come out, and we built a UI, like, adhering to it perfectly, and ended up being a beautiful UI because guess what? Those guys built a great framework and we had no designer on the team. Google was our designer. We would joke about it all the time, and we actually chose a color scheme for the company that was kind of Googley, had the same four main colors. So it was really easy to build something great. But that we really built the first version of our product was entirely open source components just glued together in a unique way. And that was our art. It was like this inner skeleton of orchestration, or just like I said, I can think of it like a lattice of glue that&#x27;s holding all these things together. And, yeah, it was a very successful product. And it looks basically how you arrange open source components is art. It&#x27;s a creative endeavor, I think, and it&#x27;s enough for a brand new product. It&#x27;s enough art. You don&#x27;t have to go and reinvent, like, for example, the airflow UI during this really hard early project. And you don&#x27;t have to go reinvent the Postgres UI. Maybe you want to, but you&#x27;re like, let&#x27;s handle the first things first. So did you think of a lesson that was non technical that you learned that you would tell your younger self or not really?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002249---phil">[00:22:49]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002249---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002249---phil" title="Direct link to 002249---phil">â</a></h5><p>Oh, I have so many. I spent a lot of time thinking after our previous companies didn&#x27;t work out specifically. I don&#x27;t know. This is a broad question. I can go in every direction. Let me think, which one is the best one to share? Yeah, I would say, okay. One interesting lesson is I&#x27;ll focus on the youth as well. And what you mentioned. When we were building our first company, our first product, we felt very righteous. We were doing something very difficult and objectively, technically difficult. And a lot of people have tried before, and we were like, they must have done it wrong. Who are they? People with more experience and context than us to know how to do this really well. And so we always started every premise of what we were doing from the premise that we were correct. Right. And then we were strived to further validate the fact that we were correct. And I think this leads to a lot of cognitive dissonance when you turn out to be wrong. Right. Because you had this idea of what you were thinking, and it&#x27;s now being challenged versus now the way we think about it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002407---phil">[00:24:07]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002407---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002407---phil" title="Direct link to 002407---phil">â</a></h5><p>And I mean this from a personal standpoint, from the way we talk and hire people, from the way we talk to customers, from the way we try to build product now, we just think we&#x27;re wrong. I always assume I&#x27;m wrong in what I think, and then I strive to prove myself correct. Right. And if we do manage to prove ourselves to be correct, then it&#x27;s like a very positive moment. You&#x27;re like, that&#x27;s amazing. I found this great surprise that I wasn&#x27;t fully convinced of before. And if you turn out to be wrong, you&#x27;re like, well, kind of thought I could be wrong all along, not a big deal, and then sort of drop this and move to something else. And I think it&#x27;s a mental framework that has served us a lot better in everything that we do now.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002445---ry">[00:24:45]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002445---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002445---ry" title="Direct link to 002445---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I love that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002447---phil">[00:24:47]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002447---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002447---phil" title="Direct link to 002447---phil">â</a></h5><p>Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002448---ry">[00:24:48]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002448---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002448---ry" title="Direct link to 002448---ry">â</a></h5><p>I think it&#x27;s a tricky catch 22.

I think it&#x27;s wrong to give up on it a lot of times, because, again, I think that some of the best ideas almost everyone would disagree with as it starts. I agree. It&#x27;s a much better mindset to understand that it&#x27;s a lottery ticket sort of odds not, hey, well, if you were a good student, you know you can get an A in a class, right?

I mean, there&#x27;s, there&#x27;s just so much that&#x27;s happening in Postgres, obviously pretty excited about Tembo. I&#x27;ve been following you guys&#x27; journey. Just like, recently, there are people that I forget the name of the developer. That&#x27;s very embarrassing. But someone released PG branching, which maybe you&#x27;ve seen, which is like, so I was talking to Nikita, the CEO of Neon, right? And he was, like, raving about their branching system, which I&#x27;m sure is world class and amazing. But it turns out other people might be able to do this someday, which is good for the community, perhaps. So I think that&#x27;s quite an exciting extension that hasn&#x27;t been made by us, for example, that we&#x27;re very excited about. And there&#x27;s many others that I could list.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002656---ry">[00:26:56]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002656---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002656---ry" title="Direct link to 002656---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, it&#x27;s interesting. My first reaction I saw, like, AWS announce, oh, we have active, active replication available on RDS. It&#x27;s a new extension, you know. And I responded on Twitter, is it going to be open source? And crickets. So it makes me feel like time to. We&#x27;ll study that extension, and the community needs to just build the open source version of it if they won&#x27;t do it. I&#x27;m not salty about how the big clouds operate. Extracting value from open source. Because I&#x27;m extracting value from open source, and you are, too. We all are. All the way down. Like I said, it&#x27;s like value extraction all the way down to Linux, but they could be. Obviously their goal is to build a proprietary alternatives and I really wish there was a Postgres company out there that was big and was worrying about the whole open source ecosystem. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re trying to do. Yeah, there&#x27;s so much going on. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m looking at it now or if things have changed in 2023 versus 2022. It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s happening too during what I would consider like a law in the venture ecosystem as well. So I think the stuff that&#x27;s happening now will be strong. They always say like the startups that start during the slow parts of venture usually end up being more successful than the ones at the hype cycle. So you and I are both lucky we&#x27;re starting here. Even those. It might not feel that way sometimes.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002839---phil">[00:28:39]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002839---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002839---phil" title="Direct link to 002839---phil">â</a></h5><p>I think it does feel that way though. We raised our seed round, things went quite well. It was a challenging raise, but challenging because people were very critical about what we&#x27;re doing and I think that&#x27;s good, right? Like the first company, we raised money on a terrible idea and we thought raising money was the good part. But actually if you have a terrible idea and people convince you of that early on, they&#x27;re actually doing you a favor, right? Yeah, I think it&#x27;s good. I&#x27;m very bullish on the companies that are going to be founded, that have been founded this year, that will be found next year and so on, because I think you&#x27;re right. Overall, typically they turn out to be quite good. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002922---ry">[00:29:22]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002922---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002922---ry" title="Direct link to 002922---ry">â</a></h5><p>So do you have a couple of favorite people that you&#x27;ve met in Postgres Land? Give them a shout out if you do.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002929---phil">[00:29:29]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002929---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002929---phil" title="Direct link to 002929---phil">â</a></h5><p>Yes, sure. I mean I met Eric, which I think will take the prize for my favorite. He. He&#x27;s very humble about it. He keeps saying TCDI needed pgrx. I think they really did it beyond what was needed for the benefit of the community. So I think he&#x27;s definitely gone above and beyond and he continues to go above and beyond. Another one maybe you know him or not. He&#x27;s the writer of one of the PG internals book called Hironobu, who&#x27;s this Japanese man who lives in Europe now I haven&#x27;t engaged with him very much, but he&#x27;s made this resource called I think InterDB.jp or something like that. I could send you the link if you&#x27;re curious, which goes into Postgres internals at a great detail. And it&#x27;s been like a good resource for us in it. So shout out to that guy.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003023---ry">[00:30:23]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003023---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003023---ry" title="Direct link to 003023---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I definitely read the website, but I haven&#x27;t spoken to the man.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003029---phil">[00:30:29]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#003029---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003029---phil" title="Direct link to 003029---phil">â</a></h5><p>Maybe we should try to email him a few times. Yeah, I tried to convince him to join us, but it was too difficult to sell.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003037---ry">[00:30:37]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003037---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003037---ry" title="Direct link to 003037---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, maybe he, I mean, I tried to convince Eric Ridge to join Tembo in the early on and he was too hard to sell.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003043---phil">[00:30:43]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#003043---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003043---phil" title="Direct link to 003043---phil">â</a></h5><p>I&#x27;m sure you did. Of course, I would have loved to convince, um, the naive part of me was like, I can&#x27;t wait to convince Eric to join Parade. And then I talked to him, realized he basically is the co founder and CTO of TCDI. And I was like, okay, this isn&#x27;t happening.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003101---ry">[00:31:01]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003101---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003101---ry" title="Direct link to 003101---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I was probably the 25th person to go after him. And you were probably the 27th person to go after him. Whatever.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003110---phil">[00:31:10]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#003110---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003110---phil" title="Direct link to 003110---phil">â</a></h5><p>Exactly.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003111---ry">[00:31:11]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003111---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003111---ry" title="Direct link to 003111---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m kind of excited that these people, I&#x27;ll call them like the gods of Postgres, are kind of locked up up on Mount Olympus. We don&#x27;t get to see them or talk to them very much. That&#x27;s exciting to me, to know that someday we&#x27;ll get there. Someday, if our companies are strong enough, maybe we can get to work with those people. But it&#x27;s great to be in an ecosystem where there is a tier of people that are just amazing. I was talking to Samay, who&#x27;s the CTO here at Tembo, and he did the quick analysis. To see that most people become a committer at Postgres takes like around seven or eight years of contributing to Postgres before you get the commit bit, which is like, wow, that is an amazing. You think of venture backed startups, it&#x27;s like two startups worth of effort sticking around for your full vesting before you get to be up. So it has nothing to do with the company that you&#x27;re working for, it&#x27;s just you&#x27;re going to dedicate yourself to an open source project for the core of your professional life. Because once you get there, you probably want to stick around for another eight years, I&#x27;m sure.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003227---ry">[00:32:27]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003227---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003227---ry" title="Direct link to 003227---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty cool.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003228---phil">[00:32:28]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#003228---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003228---phil" title="Direct link to 003228---phil">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. But these people are great, and I think that&#x27;s one of the things that&#x27;s so great about Postgres community. Even though Eric and so on, they&#x27;re amazing people and they&#x27;re doing great things and they&#x27;re very busy and so on. This are quite accessible, really. Eric is very accessible in the pgrx discord and so on. So I do feel like by building open source, we still get to work with them, even though not in the same organization. And some other people I forgot to shout out, which perhaps deserve a lot of shout out, is maybe like Umur and Ozgun from Citus, right? They were like truly visionaries of the Postgres world, building extensions when Postgres was a toy database, as people would like, critic being critical of.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003317---ry">[00:33:17]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003317---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003317---ry" title="Direct link to 003317---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, yeah, we&#x27;re definitely standing on their shoulders. They&#x27;ve, they did a lot of hard work early on and yeah, it&#x27;s great. If you had a magic wand, you could add any feature to Postgres tomorrow and it existed. Is there anything that you would use that wand on? Do you have any things you wish Postgres was that it isn&#x27;t?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003340---phil">[00:33:40]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#003340---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003340---phil" title="Direct link to 003340---phil">â</a></h5><p>That&#x27;s very interesting. I think the answer would be better distributed support. Actually, what Citus has done is amazing. But the whole reason Yugabyte exists today, for example, is because there&#x27;s only so much you can do when you&#x27;re an extension like Citus did, right? And like Yugabyte is basically trying to be the Postgres equivalent of CockroachDB. And I think if that was baked in natively to Postgres, it would be good for a lot of people that are building on Postgres included.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003413---ry">[00:34:13]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003413---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003413---ry" title="Direct link to 003413---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s a good one.

No, I listen to PostgresFM all the time. I&#x27;m huge fans of those guys. I do listen to a lot of podcasts. But yeah. Just going to ask you what your favorites are. But you already said. All right, well cool. It was great talking to you. Where can listeners find you online?

I&#x27;m curious where&#x27;d you grow up and what were you doing before?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000048---burak"><em>[00:00:48]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000048---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000048---burak" title="Direct link to 000048---burak">â</a></h5><p>Well, well hello everyone, this is Burak and I work as a software developer and I guess in reverse chronological order I worked at Microsoft, Citus Data and SAP on distributed databases in all three and currently I worked at a startup called Ubicloud. We are basically building a new cloud provider and the primary thing we do differently than other providers is that well all the code is open. You can think it as open alternative to existing cloud providers. You can go to GitHub, check out the code, set it up on a bare meta server and then you can have your own cloud or you can use our managed offering of course. So yeah, this is brief history of me working professionally.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000146---ry"><em>[00:01:46]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000146---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000146---ry" title="Direct link to 000146---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, nice. So you&#x27;re open sourcing, essentially open sourcing and what AWS and GCP and Azure have done.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000155---burak"><em>[00:01:55]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000155---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000155---burak" title="Direct link to 000155---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, definitely, I&#x27;m seeing it what Linux is to proprietary operating systems. This is what we are doing for the cloud providers.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000207---ry"><em>[00:02:07]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000207---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000207---ry" title="Direct link to 000207---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, and you only have to build 300 different services on top of it. Right, but luckily a lot of those are open source too.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000215---burak"><em>[00:02:15]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000215---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000215---burak" title="Direct link to 000215---burak">â</a></h5><p>Kind of. Well, I guess our current plan is not building all 200 render services because most of the time people use only ten at most 20. If you implement 20 of them, I guess you have 80% of the use cases. So I guess this is our initial plan but we never know what would feature show.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000242---ry"><em>[00:02:42]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000242---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000242---ry" title="Direct link to 000242---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think it&#x27;s a great idea. I&#x27;m excited to watch it evolve and hopefully partner with you guys at some point.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000250---burak"><em>[00:02:50]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000250---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000250---burak" title="Direct link to 000250---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that would be awesome.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000252---ry"><em>[00:02:52]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000252---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000252---ry" title="Direct link to 000252---ry">â</a></h5><p>Do you remember when you first started using Postgres?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000257---burak"><em>[00:02:57]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000257---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000257---burak" title="Direct link to 000257---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I do. Well to be honest, when I start programming I started as a web developer and at that time Lamp stack was very common. So my first database was MySQL but then I started working at Citus Data and which is the place that I started working development part of the Postgres. So basically for people who don&#x27;t know Site, the Sitestata was the company behind many popular extensions such as Citus or Pgcron or PostgreSQL HLL. So when I first joined Citus Data, I initially worked on building Citus extension and while doing that you need to dig to the Postgres code first you need to understand and then you build your extension on top of it. And then we built our own managed service. So I switched to that team to build a Postgres managed service and some of our customers were well, they were heavily using PostgresQL HLL extension and at that time the original authors of the PostgreSQL HLL extension, they went through an acquisition process and they didn&#x27;t have enough time at their hand to maintain the extension. And well, we know the people and at that time PostgreSQL Community was much smaller.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000437---burak"><em>[00:04:37]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000437---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000437---burak" title="Direct link to 000437---burak">â</a></h5><p>So we just called them and said that, hey, we want to maintain this extension, what do you think about? And they were pretty happy to find a new maintainer. So, long story short, I found myself as the maintainer of the PostgreSQL extension and then the Citus Data got acquired by Microsoft and then well, I continued my Postgres journey on Microsoft. Like we also build a managed server stash. Yeah, I guess that&#x27;s how I start with Postgres development. Well, not just start like till the almost whole journey.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000518---ry"><em>[00:05:18]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000518---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000518---ry" title="Direct link to 000518---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. And are you taking a little bit of a break from it right now or are you working on Postgres stuff over at Ubicloud?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000531---burak"><em>[00:05:31]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000531---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000531---burak" title="Direct link to 000531---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, first of all, we use Postgres in Ubicloud as like most of my professional community, like the friends, and they are from Postgres Community, so there&#x27;s no way I can leave that community at all. But as a cloud provider, Ubicloud also needs to offer a Postgres service. So we are planning some things like it&#x27;s not very well defined yet, but I think eventually we will have something for Postgres as well.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000612---ry"><em>[00:06:12]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000612---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000612---ry" title="Direct link to 000612---ry">â</a></h5><p>Out of curiosity, are you guys I&#x27;m sure this is a hotly debated topic, but Kubernetes or no Kubernetes inside of UBI Cloud?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000622---burak"><em>[00:06:22]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000622---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000622---burak" title="Direct link to 000622---burak">â</a></h5><p>Well, in our case right now, no Kubernetes. We have pretty simple control plane, which if you want, I think you can move it to Kubernetes. But right now we don&#x27;t use it. Not that we have anything against Kubernetes, it&#x27;s just I guess right now we don&#x27;t need that complexity, I believe.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000650---ry"><em>[00:06:50]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000650---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000650---ry" title="Direct link to 000650---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, and I imagine you&#x27;ll have managed Kubernetes. You&#x27;d have to have that. That&#x27;ll be one of your 1st 20 most likely.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000657---burak"><em>[00:06:57]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000657---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000657---burak" title="Direct link to 000657---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, definitely. Because managed Kubernetes is quite one of the most demanded products, so it needs to be one of the first.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000711---ry"><em>[00:07:11]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000711---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000711---ry" title="Direct link to 000711---ry">â</a></h5><p>Well, so again, you were working on Citus...When you started working on it, was it an extension or was it, I don&#x27;t know the full history? Was it a fork at any point and then became extension?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000725---burak"><em>[00:07:25]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000725---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000725---burak" title="Direct link to 000725---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, at the beginning it was a fork and just before I joined the team it become an extension. So basically Citus become an extension and become an open source at the same time. And I think I joined Citus team in like one month after that. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000745---ry"><em>[00:07:45]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000745---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000745---ry" title="Direct link to 000745---ry">â</a></h5><p>Got it. So you never were part of that previous era. Were a lot of the hard problems already solved, would you say, with Citus? Usually. I just did a talk with the PostGIS team and they said early on is where they solved the most of the problems and it was more gradual after that. Is that the case with Citus too, or was there a big project that happened after you joined well, I think.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000819---burak"><em>[00:08:19]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000819---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000819---burak" title="Direct link to 000819---burak">â</a></h5><p>Most of the difficult problems were already solved and to be honest, I think one of the problems with the extension development is that there isn&#x27;t good documentation about it. Like for Postgres has pretty good documentation for user facing features. But if you want to as a developer, there isn&#x27;t that much resources so you usually need to read lots of Postgres code. And to be honest, I think Postgres code is pretty readable for a project at its size and that big and that old, so I think that&#x27;s a huge plus. But still you need to read lots of code to understand what you need to do. And in our case, thankfully, Citrus hired one of the most prominent contributors of the Postgres Andres Freund and he primarily lead the effort to make Citus an extension. And I think at that time I believe Postgres extension framework also didn&#x27;t have some of the features we need. So we had to do some hacky workaround. But eventually Postgres extension framework also got improved and we had chance to remove those hacky workaround.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000948---ry"><em>[00:09:48]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000948---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000948---ry" title="Direct link to 000948---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s great. Yeah, it sounds like that&#x27;s happening now with lots know a lot of the innovation in Postgres happens as a fork with the hope that in a version or two can become an extension and then maybe a couple of versions. After that it becomes a less hacky extension. Right? You can streamline it, but it&#x27;s a four year journey or so. Tell me about PostgreSQL HLL. Tell me what&#x27;s HLL stand for.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001019---burak"><em>[00:10:19]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001019---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001019---burak" title="Direct link to 001019---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, HLL stands for Hyperlog log and it is an extension to make a cardinality estimation, which is a fancy way of saying doing count distinct but approximately. Let me first explain why approximately. The reason is doing count distinct as an accurate number is pretty difficult. Well, not difficult, but maybe unfeasible. If your data size is small, that&#x27;s okay. But if you have lots of data, the usual way is keeping a hash map or hash set. Every time you see an item you put it to hash set and at the end you count number of items in it. But if you have lots of data that becomes unfeasible. If you have a distributed system, like if you are doing count testing in two different nodes, that becomes even more difficult. Because let&#x27;s say you bite the bullet and calculate the counter stick in one node and the other node, it&#x27;s not possible to merge the result. Because there might be common elements, you cannot just sum them up. So what Hyperlog log does is it uses an approximation algorithm. I can go into detail of it as well to have an internal representation of the number of unique elements which is both memory efficient compared to doing a hash map which is also easy to merge.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001204---burak"><em>[00:12:04]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001204---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001204---burak" title="Direct link to 001204---burak">â</a></h5><p>So it allows you to do like the parallel computing. And the only gotcha is it is not an exact number, it&#x27;s an approximation, but it turns out that we don&#x27;t need exact number most of the time. Like for example, especially in analytical use cases, let&#x27;s say you want to count the number of unique users that visit your website. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they are 4 million or 4.1 million, like you want a ballpark number. And also the good thing is the error rate of hyperlog log is quite small. It is usually around 2% and you can make it even smaller if you give it a bit more memory like you can make it more accurate while this hyperlog log algorithm is just out there. And what PostgreSQL hyperlog log does is it implements this algorithm for PostgreSQL.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001309---ry"><em>[00:13:09]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001309---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001309---ry" title="Direct link to 001309---ry">â</a></h5><p>So how much of a resource reduction would you estimate that using an approximation? So you lose a percentage or two of accuracy, but you get how much less compute required?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001324---burak"><em>[00:13:24]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001324---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001324---burak" title="Direct link to 001324---burak">â</a></h5><p>Well, usually it&#x27;s about 1.5 KB. So the hyperlogo data structure on default it takes about 1.5 KB memory.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001338---ry"><em>[00:13:38]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001338---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001338---ry" title="Direct link to 001338---ry">â</a></h5><p>Orders of magnitude smaller.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001340---burak"><em>[00:13:40]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001340---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001340---burak" title="Direct link to 001340---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, actually log log parts come from that. So if you are dealing with 32 bit integers, it can go up to two to the 32. You get the log of that, it is 32. You get another log that you get five. So you need five bits of memory to be able to store one bucket. And then what hyperlog log does is it keeps multiple buckets to increase the accuracy. So at the end it end up about like 1.5 kilobyte.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001417---ry"><em>[00:14:17]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001417---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001417---ry" title="Direct link to 001417---ry">â</a></h5><p>Got it. So how involved were you in that extension? Did you start it or did you inherit it?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001425---burak"><em>[00:14:25]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001425---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001425---burak" title="Direct link to 001425---burak">â</a></h5><p>I inherited it. So actually another startup called Aggregate Knowledge built that extension. Then I think they got acquired by New Star and at that time the project was not maintained frequently. So there were some boxes we need to be merged in and our customers were also using it. So we contacted the original authors and said that hey, we want to maintain this. And they were happy to hand over the maintainership to us. And then after that we did bug fixes, we did regular releases. I presented a few conference talks about hyperlog log  in Pgcomp EU and Pgcomp US. Yeah, that&#x27;s the overall story.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001524---ry"><em>[00:15:24]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001524---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001524---ry" title="Direct link to 001524---ry">â</a></h5><p>I&#x27;m curious, have you been able to disconnect from I imagine it&#x27;s easier to disconnect from Citus as an extension after leaving Microsoft, but disconnecting from this extension PostgreSQL HLL.

Well, for example, there were few improvements that I wanted to do, but I didn&#x27;t have time while working at Microsoft and it just, itched me from time to time and it is open source. So I guess at some point in near future I&#x27;ll open a pull request and hopefully it would get merged. I hope.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001619---ry"><em>[00:16:19]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001619---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001619---ry" title="Direct link to 001619---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, but Microsoft team controls that extension as it sits.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001625---burak"><em>[00:16:25]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001625---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001625---burak" title="Direct link to 001625---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, right now Microsoft team controls, they continue to do regular releases and every time new PostgreSQL version comes up they ensure that it works well and they update the packages, release new packages.

How many total extensions would you say like Microsoft has in Postgres? I know maybe it&#x27;s hard to nail down a number, but there are a bunch of others too.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001701---burak"><em>[00:17:01]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001701---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001701---burak" title="Direct link to 001701---burak">â</a></h5><p>There are there&#x27;s Citus, there&#x27;s PostgresQL HLL. There is Pgcron which is also quite popular. It is a Chrome based job scheduler.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001710---ry"><em>[00:17:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001710---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001710---ry" title="Direct link to 001710---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I just started using that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001712---burak"><em>[00:17:12]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001712---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001712---burak" title="Direct link to 001712---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s pretty cool. It is primarily developed by Marco Slot. There is one extension to ensure that Postgres works. Postgres is well integrated with Azure. So there&#x27;s like an extension called PG Azure. I think it&#x27;s not open source but if you start a Postgres instance from Azure and check the extensions, if there&#x27;s that extension there is TopN which is also approximation based extension. It gives you top N elements of a sorted list. And if you think about it is also expensive operation to do on big data set because you need to sort them first and take the top N. And I think there are more optimized algorithms that where you can keep heap which is more memory efficient but you still need to go over lots of data at that time. At Citus we also developed this TopN extension. Actually, if you look at it, the general team is about being able to do things at scale because Postgres is already pretty good at doing things in a single node. And like the title primary use case was make. A distributed PostgreSQL and we developed few extensions to make some operations that are not feasible to do at scale and find a ways to make them more feasible.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001906---ry"><em>[00:19:06]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001906---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001906---ry" title="Direct link to 001906---ry">â</a></h5><p>So I&#x27;m curious, are there some big milestones in Postgres that you&#x27;re looking forward to?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001914---burak"><em>[00:19:14]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001914---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001914---burak" title="Direct link to 001914---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, actually I was looking forward for Postgres 16 release mostly because of the logical replication improvement. There are few and I think there will be more upcoming because I think logical replication is a very powerful concept but it&#x27;s still a bit cumbersome to use it with PostgreSQL, especially when there&#x27;s a change in the data, like if when you run a DDL command or when you have a failover. So there are few gotcha and I think with the Postgres 16 some of these are less problematic and maybe I hope in the upcoming versions it would be even easier to use. Well, when you have a very solid logical replication, it opens up lots of cool features. Well, one thing that I personally invested in is being able to do zero downtime failovers and when I say zero time downtime, I mean like the real zero downtime. Not just like 1 second downtime, but real zero downtime. And I think logical replication, solid logical replication would open up that yeah, I agree.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002045---ry"><em>[00:20:45]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002045---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002045---ry" title="Direct link to 002045---ry">â</a></h5><p>It&#x27;s one thing to do that too with a single node versus a Citus cluster too right. Zero downtime gets complicated the more complicated your deployment is. But I agree on a single deployment I have this idea where we could basically build scaffolding around the existing thing, whatever it takes, like get another one working. In other words, temporarily have replication happening and then somehow seamlessly up above you have to have some fulcrum that you can so it&#x27;s a complicated thing to figure out but I think it&#x27;d be great for a managed service provider to basically build up temporary infrastructure that helps the zero downtime thing happen. If that&#x27;s true, then you can restart for all kinds of reasons with impunity like auto scaling is possible, stuff like that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002150---burak"><em>[00:21:50]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#002150---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002150---burak" title="Direct link to 002150---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, and one reason I especially interested in was that in our previous managed service we do lots of operations via failover. Like for example, if you want to scale up what we would do is we create another server with higher number of cores and then we would do failover. Or if you want to like for example, we might need to do maintenance like maybe we found a security vulnerability or there is the regular maintenance. What we would do is instead of going and patching the existing server we would create a new one and then we do a failover to that one and each of those failovers. It takes some amount of downtime which is not obviously not preferable and not a good experience for customers but if they were virtually free from the perspective of customer if they don&#x27;t even notice that there&#x27;s a failover then you can do as many failovers as you want.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002255---ry"><em>[00:22:55]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002255---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002255---ry" title="Direct link to 002255---ry">â</a></h5><p>You share the same vision as I do there. I think it would be exciting to get there. So I&#x27;m curious though, if there was one thing that you could if you had a magic wand and this weekend something new would be in Postgres core, what would it be? What would you use that wand on?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002311---burak"><em>[00:23:11]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#002311---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002311---burak" title="Direct link to 002311---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s difficult. I want lots of things like picking one is difficult but I guess one thing that bothers me is that for high availability and backups you always need to depend the third party tool I would really love that to be sold in Postgres. Like for example, for Redis it comes with very good default settings that you can use for high availability. But for Postgres there are solutions. There are good solutions but I would love them to be in the core.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002403---ry"><em>[00:24:03]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002403---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002403---ry" title="Direct link to 002403---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I get that for sure. It&#x27;s tricky when you have to buy a product or let&#x27;s say you adopt a product and you immediately have to adopt x additional products right off the bat and that&#x27;s not a good feeling. It feels complex, right? Yeah, that&#x27;s cool, I would say. Do you have any opinions about Postgres that almost nobody agrees with you about? Are you a contrarian in any area that you can think of?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002435---burak"><em>[00:24:35]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#002435---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002435---burak" title="Direct link to 002435---burak">â</a></h5><p>Let me see.

So instead of having a lot of specialized databases, you can have Postgres. And with some configuration and maybe few extensions, you can implement, like you can implement Kafka in Postgres, you can implement Redis, you can implement like the NoSQL in Postgres. I guess if I said this maybe two, three years ago, probably I would get more raised eye growth. But now I think more people start thinking to think like that. I think Tembo is also thinking things along similar lines, right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002614---ry"><em>[00:26:14]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002614---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002614---ry" title="Direct link to 002614---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think there&#x27;s openness to it. I talked to a lot of people, and the question is how people are Postgres for everything. Or question is what percentage of developers are actually on that bandwagon? Obviously on Twitter, it just takes one person, and it&#x27;s a big community, too, especially if it&#x27;s a contrarian view. But I&#x27;m kind of curious. One of the things I want to find out over the next few months is what percentage of developers would actually if this Postgres for Everything was real, would they actually use it versus still saying &quot;Ehh.&quot; And I think it all comes down to like I think, yeah, you can do Kafka, like work on Postgres right now, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as buying Confluent. That seems like a very safe decision. And doing something like Kafka on Postgres seems like you&#x27;re just kind of stringing together a Rube Goldberg machine and it doesn&#x27;t feel like a solid. But the question is, if those solutions were solid, would people use them? And that&#x27;s our big thesis, is that if they were solid, people would use them. But I just don&#x27;t know what percentage of people would do that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002738---ry"><em>[00:27:38]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002738---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002738---ry" title="Direct link to 002738---ry">â</a></h5><p>A big percentage or a small percentage?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002740---burak"><em>[00:27:40]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#002740---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002740---burak" title="Direct link to 002740---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I&#x27;m not sure. But there is one interesting thing that come into my mind, is, well, today Postgres supports JSONB type, but it was not like that all the time. So in the earlier days, if you want to store JSON data, we had an extension called hstore, which we still have, but not as commonly used as before. And what hstore does is, and this is one of the very powerful part of PostgreSQL extension framework, hstore defined the data type, and on top of it, they defined how you can hash this data type and how you can compare this data type. And when you do this in Postgres, Postgres allows you to create index on that data type. So suddenly you are not only able to store JSON data, but you can index it. And at that time this is kind of rare things even for NoSQL database. So I think it&#x27;s a bit funny. And also it shows the power of PostgreSQL extension framework is that suddenly you are able to do what NoSQL database does but better. I mean, not in all perspectives, like connection scaling was still a problem, but being able to index NoSQL data, being able to index JSON, it was a rare feature even for NoSQL databases.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002919---burak"><em>[00:29:19]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#002919---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002919---burak" title="Direct link to 002919---burak">â</a></h5><p>But you had it in Postgres. I don&#x27;t know, maybe some of these other databases or other use cases Postgres might have something unexpected that would make it better.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002936---ry"><em>[00:29:36]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002936---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002936---ry" title="Direct link to 002936---ry">â</a></h5><p>An unexpected advantage. Yeah, it&#x27;s the same way with pgvector right now the great thing about doing vector embeddings inside of Postgres is that you don&#x27;t have to move the data out of Postgres as part of the process. Right. You can just add a column and keep it where it is, whereas anybody else has if it&#x27;s an external vector database that&#x27;s specific for that use case, you have to have data pipelines and all that kind of machinery. Which that&#x27;s to me, one of the big benefits of keeping it all in Postgres is less data movement. And less data movement can mean much like no data delays and all that kind of stuff go away. So yeah, I agree with you, there&#x27;s a lot of unexpected benefits for keeping things together.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003025---burak"><em>[00:30:25]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#003025---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003025---burak" title="Direct link to 003025---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I guess since Postgres provides pretty strong asset guarantees, it allows you to build things on top of that. And when you have asset, then you can be much more free to develop complex features. Because what I realize is like while developing software, most of the time as a developer, I try to ensure that hey, what I&#x27;m doing is atomic or what I&#x27;m doing does not it is isolate. So it&#x27;s not caused any problems if something is coming and not in the expected order. But you have chance to delegate all this to Postgres, I think that gives you quite a bit of advantage.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003121---ry"><em>[00:31:21]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003121---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003121---ry" title="Direct link to 003121---ry">â</a></h5><p>Well, one of the things I love too is that because the Postgres core team is quite separated from the commercial products, is that I just think it seems like a very stable chassis to build these things on top of. And you really can&#x27;t if it&#x27;s more of a captive, open source project, say, like what Kafka is to Confluent. They can move Kafka quickly if they need to for commercial to help their commercial product, but that could introduce more instability. I just don&#x27;t see this Postgres team doing anything very risky, which to me is a great counterbalance to people developers trying to move fast and build crazy cool new things. It&#x27;s just nice to have that as a stability factor, I think, inside the product.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003217---burak"><em>[00:32:17]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#003217---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003217---burak" title="Direct link to 003217---burak">â</a></h5><p>I think so, yeah. Well, I guess historically I think the Postgres community kind of divided into camps and some of them would want to implement new shiny thing and some of them would try to hey, just let&#x27;s get stabilized. And I believe this JSONB support comes from the part who wants to innovate and try new things. And at the beginning, I think they got some hesitation from the other company. But at the end, I guess what they do proved itself to be very valuable. And then now JSONB support is one of the most widely used features of Postgres. Yeah, so I guess there is some sort of balance to try risky things and also try being stabilized.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003310---ry"><em>[00:33:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003310---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003310---ry" title="Direct link to 003310---ry">â</a></h5><p>If you look at the number of the change log for Postgres 16 they did a lot of things. It&#x27;s almost more than anyone can keep in their head. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying. The good stuff gets through, it&#x27;s just the bar is high and then with a lot of assurances that they didn&#x27;t break any part of Postgres in the process. I really appreciate that part of this thing and it&#x27;s one of the reasons why I&#x27;m so excited to be building a product on top of it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003341---burak"><em>[00:33:41]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#003341---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003341---burak" title="Direct link to 003341---burak">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, at the same time it is sometimes bit frustrating because sometimes you have a feature you want it to be merged in like you might be author or you might be just someone watching from the site and desperately need that feature. And then you see that there is a huge discussion going on and people cannot convince each other and it falls to the next cycle, which is like the one years later. So that&#x27;s a bit frustrating but I guess yeah, it is kind of cost of having a quite stable system.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003418---ry"><em>[00:34:18]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003418---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003418---ry" title="Direct link to 003418---ry">â</a></h5><p>It&#x27;s the cost. And like I said, well, obviously I haven&#x27;t been here for the 26 years watching the mailing lists and maybe I&#x27;m jumping in here relatively late in a cycle and I just appreciate all the efforts and all the debates and all the fights that have happened there because I think it&#x27;s created such a great core engine.

And today I have Regina Obe and Paul Ramsey, two who are working and have been working on PostGIS for quite some time. Welcome to the show, both of you.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000028---regina"><em>[00:00:28]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000028---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000028---regina" title="Direct link to 000028---regina">â</a></h5><p>Thanks, Ry.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000028---paul"><em>[00:00:28]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000028---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000028---paul" title="Direct link to 000028---paul">â</a></h5><p>Thanks, Ry.

Maybe. Paul, when did you start using Postgres?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000042---paul"><em>[00:00:42]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000042---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000042---paul" title="Direct link to 000042---paul">â</a></h5><p>I started using Postgres, and I&#x27;m sure I can give you a version number, I think like 6.4, which I think puts me in like the &#x27;98, &#x27;99 era. And yeah, I was using it as a consultant. My first career was in consulting and working for the provincial government. And we were doing a big data analysis project and it was a geospatial project, but all the geospatial processing was being done by an external piece of software and we used Postgres as the backing store for what was a very long, like, 20 day compute cycle to spit out all the results for the entire province. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000117---ry"><em>[00:01:17]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000117---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000117---ry" title="Direct link to 000117---ry">â</a></h5><p>Nice. How about you, Regina?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000118---regina"><em>[00:01:18]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000118---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000118---regina" title="Direct link to 000118---regina">â</a></h5><p>I started out as a SQL Server person, so yeah, Paul dragged me into Postgres. So my first introduction was via PostGIS in 2001, I think it was. So it was like 7.1 or 7.3, I can&#x27;t remember somewhere between 7.1 and 7.3.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000139---paul"><em>[00:01:39]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000139---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000139---paul" title="Direct link to 000139---paul">â</a></h5><p>It was 7.1 because that was the first version of Postgres that you could actually do a geospatial extension. Oh, nice.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000145---ry"><em>[00:01:45]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000145---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000145---ry" title="Direct link to 000145---ry">â</a></h5><p>And do you regret leaving SQL Server?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000149---regina"><em>[00:01:49]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000149---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000149---regina" title="Direct link to 000149---regina">â</a></h5><p>Well, I still consult for SQL Server, and what&#x27;s interesting about that is I think I&#x27;ve gotten to be a better SQL Server expert knowing Postgres because Postgres would always introduce things first, like all the lead functions, all the window functions, Postgres introduced those before SQL Server had them and the CTEs and everything.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000218---ry"><em>[00:02:18]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000218---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000218---ry" title="Direct link to 000218---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, got it. What&#x27;s the state of geospatial in Microsoft SQL Server, would you say compared to Postgres? I don&#x27;t know too much about that ecosystem, but I&#x27;m curious, how much parity have they achieved?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000232---regina"><em>[00:02:32]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000232---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000232---regina" title="Direct link to 000232---regina">â</a></h5><p>Well, I think their geography is still better than ours, but in terms of the geometry support, they&#x27;re way behind, which is what most of the state people care about.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000242---ry"><em>[00:02:42]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000242---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000242---ry" title="Direct link to 000242---ry">â</a></h5><p>Awesome. Cool. All right, well, I&#x27;m going to kind of go off my standard script because how long have you guys been working on PostGIS for? This is one of the oldest extensions, or is it the oldest extension?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000259---paul"><em>[00:02:59]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000259---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000259---paul" title="Direct link to 000259---paul">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, I mean, so when we started extension, this didn&#x27;t exist. It&#x27;s a pre extension as a package concept. It&#x27;s just like the idea of runtime, adding things at runtime to the database which was there from the very beginning. That was a stonebreaker original. Like, this is one of the things Postgres can do. PostGIS is from 2001, as Regina mentioned, she started using it within three months of the initial release. So, yeah, may of 2001. So yeah, we&#x27;re at 22 years.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000328---ry"><em>[00:03:28]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000328---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000328---ry" title="Direct link to 000328---ry">â</a></h5><p>So how has it, has it changed much? Would you say since? Has it been pretty steady progress towards what it is now? Or were there any big milestones, big changes that you can remember that are super noteworthy?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000342---paul"><em>[00:03:42]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000342---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000342---paul" title="Direct link to 000342---paul">â</a></h5><p>It has not been like one linear rise. It&#x27;s definitely been punctuated equilibrium. And as these things go, the most new features and new capabilities happen right at the start, because we started with nothing, right? We started with first release. It had geospatial types, it had a geospatial index. It had eight functions, I think only one of which was analytical in any way. But that was like release 0.1 in 2001. I think we got to 0.8 in two years, like 2003. And that had the first full set of spatial functions where you could really test all the relationships between the geometries. You could do constructive geometry operations like buffering intersections and unions and so on in the geometries, that was the really big like, you could have stopped there in many respects. If you look at what SQL Server has, that&#x27;s kind of what they did until 2008. They had no spatial at all. And then they came out with their spatial extension, which was basically what they have now because it was a capable, complete vector spatial database, full stop. But since then, we&#x27;ve kept adding stuff. Maybe Regina will take another tour of what she thinks the biggest things to happen since 0.8 were yeah, so I.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000508---regina"><em>[00:05:08]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000508---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000508---regina" title="Direct link to 000508---regina">â</a></h5><p>Think PostGIS just improved as Postgres improved. So they introduced Gist and all our indexes changed from the old R-tree to the Gist index. They improved aggregation in Postgres, which I think was a huge milestone for us because a lot of the processing we do involves aggregating geometries together. So we would see something like from a tenfold speed improvement in terms of aggregation of geometries. And then the other things. I think CTEs were pretty useful. Now, nobody does any queries in Spatial without using a CTE anymore.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000601---ry"><em>[00:06:01]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000601---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000601---ry" title="Direct link to 000601---ry">â</a></h5><p>Would you say, like those advances in Postgres? I don&#x27;t know. Let&#x27;s say that they did 80% of the work towards the thing working ten times faster, and you guys had to do 20%.

Well, I don&#x27;t know. There are a lot of things. As a geospatial extension, our code isn&#x27;t packed like into one hunk of code that we control. We use a lot of library dependencies. And so we end up having, and we still do having a really complex build almost right out of the gate compared to other extensions, because other extensions like, hey, we&#x27;re a self contained thing. You just type, make and you&#x27;re done. Whereas with us it was always like, hey, guess what? You get to track down three or four different other libraries in addition to the thing that we have and make sure they&#x27;re the right versions, and here&#x27;s the configuration, so on. So we end up with this really naughty configuration setup. And initially, like, if you&#x27;re going to start using this stuff back in the day, step one was always to build it. They weren&#x27;t prepackaged.

GEOS is an acronym of course, stands for Geometry Engine open source. It provides the computational geometry underpinnings for a bunch of sort of the key functions. I mentioned a buffer, that&#x27;s a GEOs function at the back end. Intersection is a GEOS function at the back end. The Boolean predicates intersects contains within those are all GEOS functions at the back end. Some of the fancier stuff that we&#x27;ve added to GEOS is now exposed in PostGIS. So if you ask for Delaunay triangles or <!-- -->[...]<!-- --> polygons, you get those from GEOS and then GEOS, because it&#x27;s like this useful Swiss Army knife of computational geometry is used by other programs in the geospatial ecosystem. So if you use the Google library, it backs out of GEOS for its geospatial operations. And like most prominently, if you use the QGIS desktop GIS, you&#x27;ll find that the Q just backstops its geospatial algorithms.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000954---ry"><em>[00:09:54]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000954---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000954---ry" title="Direct link to 000954---ry">â</a></h5><p>So did you guys refactor code into that, or did you just end up replacing some stuff you had built early on with that library later on?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001001---regina"><em>[00:10:01]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#001001---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001001---regina" title="Direct link to 001001---regina">â</a></h5><p>Well, Paul started GEOS too.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001004---ry"><em>[00:10:04]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001004---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001004---ry" title="Direct link to 001004---ry">â</a></h5><p>Okay.

Maybe we should talk about this in the part we have a little get together, because it&#x27;s one of the things which in front of me lately is like the underlying infrastructure we have for handling rasters was built well, no, 2010, anyways. It was built, like, in an era when the idea of, say, doing cloud based raster processing was kind of not what would be done. It was built around the idea that you would store your own rasters kind of locally in your local area network, that increasingly organizations just don&#x27;t do that. They still want to have raster access. And while you can do remote raster access with what we have, it&#x27;s kind of clunky. It&#x27;s not optimized for that at all. I feel like just like a relook at what the raster use cases are and kind of a reevaluation of whether how we handle rasters is right is due. I was looking at the API that Alibaba offers on their cloud databases and thinking, yeah, that&#x27;s kind of an interesting way of tackling rasters.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001217---ry"><em>[00:12:17]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001217---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001217---ry" title="Direct link to 001217---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, you&#x27;re talking about like Alibaba is like a they have a proprietary database or not, their Postgres.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001225---paul"><em>[00:12:25]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#001225---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001225---paul" title="Direct link to 001225---paul">â</a></h5><p>They don&#x27;t say. They&#x27;re really cagey about it. So I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s back then Postgres or not, but their take on rasters is very much all their own.

At a conceptual level, they&#x27;re the same. But from a practicality point of view, the practicalities of handling super high dimensional stuff are just different. Like one of the first things you learn, even like we go to four dimensions, even at four dimensions, the indexing properties start to break down if the kind of sort of standard R-tree stuff just doesn&#x27;t work as nicely. You don&#x27;t have to get very high up into a complex dimensional space for that form of indexing to be like, it doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s not doing what we need to do. And you can really see that in just how different the indexing approaches are for ML vectors compared to sort of 2D vectors.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001410---ry"><em>[00:14:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001410---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001410---ry" title="Direct link to 001410---ry">â</a></h5><p>So, like, high dimensionality just requires an entirely different mindset and solution set.

And PostGIS is interesting in being like one of the few Postgres extensions which has received achieved that level. But even at that level, it&#x27;s quite small. So you got Regina, who has a good consulting business.

I&#x27;m frequently, frequently surprised by how much internal churn there is because I always feel like, oh, we&#x27;re the supermature extension.

And yet there&#x27;s always this there&#x27;s always this medium to long list of things that have to be tweaked when you move up to a new, like in terms of our code or for it to build and still run correctly, that have to be tweaked at each major Postgres release.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002057---regina"><em>[00:20:57]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#002057---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002057---regina" title="Direct link to 002057---regina">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, because I can&#x27;t think of any release we&#x27;ve done that we didn&#x27;t have to tweak it for the in development major release of Postgres.

I&#x27;m curious, are there things happening in Postgres core that you guys are excited about? Maybe for we could talk about 17 or whatever, 18 future?

I&#x27;ve been watching the decade long crawl towards being able to do a replicated OLAP system where you get full push down to all the nodes. So every release, the Postgres FTW folks from Toshiba and other places add a couple more turns of stuff that you can push down, which is exciting to me because we&#x27;re that much closer. We&#x27;re that much closer to be able to do big multi node queries because there&#x27;s OLAP workloads and LTP workloads for spatial databases. Really, the bias is towards OLAP for sure. In terms of what you see, how you see people using the database. I mean, they like transactionality, they like to be able to manipulate their data. But when it comes time to ask, what is this for? It&#x27;s like, oh yeah, we run big analyzes. So the ability to push stuff out to multi node as that gets more mature, as it gets more possible, like, that becomes something that&#x27;s really exciting on the spatial side. So I watch every little tick of the gears towards that endpoint and get very excited. So it&#x27;s been pushed down in the last couple of releases.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002322---paul"><em>[00:23:22]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#002322---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002322---paul" title="Direct link to 002322---paul">â</a></h5><p>Last release had good stuff around parallelization in the planner and executor as well for partitions, which is like, that&#x27;s a big deal because the holy grail is you&#x27;ve got your big table partitioned out across the remote nodes. So each of your partition is actually a foreign table. And when you run the query, the planner says, oh, look, I can just ask all the partitions to run it simultaneously, it gets back the result, assembles it and says, Here you go, we&#x27;re getting close to that. Which would be a big deal because there&#x27;s a whole bunch of workloads that you can just turn into sort of like a standard OLAP star schema. One big fact table, a bunch of dimensions and you&#x27;d be able to do lots of really cool spatial stuff. That right now, not so much. I don&#x27;t know when we&#x27;ll ever get to the holy grail, which is to be able be able to do shipping data between nodes in order to allow nodes do things like join across these across two big fact tables. That might never happen. I don&#x27;t see anyone doing that. But that&#x27;s the one that would like having me tear my clothes off and dancing in the street.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002434---ry"><em>[00:24:34]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002434---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002434---ry" title="Direct link to 002434---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah.

And so it&#x27;s just a way to have the extension machinery understand that, hey, this script can be used to upgrade this version, this version, this version and this version, instead of having to itemize every single version upgrade.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002730---paul"><em>[00:27:30]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#002730---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002730---paul" title="Direct link to 002730---paul">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, the extension upgrade machinery is very clever, but it starts with an immediate assumption, which is that as a developer, you will manage your extension upgrades as incrementals between versions and that it will cleverly find the path through the incrementals from the version you have to the version you&#x27;re going to, applying all the little slices on the way.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002755---regina"><em>[00:27:55]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#002755---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002755---regina" title="Direct link to 002755---regina">â</a></h5><p>And it uses Dijkstra for that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002758---paul"><em>[00:27:58]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#002758---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002758---paul" title="Direct link to 002758---paul">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, it&#x27;s super clever. Even like in the best case scenario where you&#x27;d already been doing that, it&#x27;s probably not super ideal for any project where the development path isn&#x27;t linear. So Post just has, I don&#x27;t know, 25 or so minor releases like X, Y, and then within those, there&#x27;s maybe five patch releases across each of those. So we&#x27;ll have a whole bunch of parallel version trees, right? You&#x27;re on 2.3.5, or you&#x27;re going to go to 2.3.6, but then you might want to go to 2.4.8. And that means you have to have all these individual even if you&#x27;re doing things like one tiny step of time, you would have all these individual little hops across the branches. If you have just this one line, it kind of worked. You just sort of chained together this one little line. You don&#x27;t have very many files when you have all these little branches, all of a sudden you need all these extra little hops across the branches. And it&#x27;s made worse because all of our management of the SQL side of it, the SQL side of the extension where you define the functions on SQL land and say, oh, it&#x27;s over here in the dynamic library.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002924---paul"><em>[00:29:24]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#002924---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002924---paul" title="Direct link to 002924---paul">â</a></h5><p>We&#x27;ve been managing that since pre extension world. And our way of managing it was to have a SQL file which can always be cleanly applied against any previous version. So it&#x27;s quite long because the SQL file has every single definition of every single thing in it. So how you handle the incremental thing from 1.2 to 1.3? Well you have one copy for 1.31 copy for the upgrade as well. So every little upgrade has a full copy of that fairly large SQL file. On Unix systems now we just ship sip links instead of syncing the whole file. But you end up with just a huge pile.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003005---regina"><em>[00:30:05]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#003005---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003005---regina" title="Direct link to 003005---regina">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, actually we changed from that to just a file that has nothing in it.

But I think ours is more complicated too because for each version we support multiple versions of Postgres and we also enable new features.

Our input file actually goes through, we put it through the C preprocessor before we give it to Postgres because we have a whole bunch of if defs against what Postgres version you&#x27;re on.

Was maybe you&#x27;re saying like the current design is just naive thinking that you&#x27;re not going to try to support multiple versions of Postgres with one of your versions of the extension and there&#x27;s not home for that information, I guess for what the range is to some degree.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003122---paul"><em>[00:31:22]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#003122---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003122---paul" title="Direct link to 003122---paul">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I mean although the extension framework does contemplate the idea of versioned extensions, again, it doesn&#x27;t really contemplate them as anything except for a linear chain. And once you have a more complex situation than that it&#x27;s kind of hard. Like we for a very long time supported being able to run different versions of PostGIS inside the same Postgres cluster. We still do actually support that, but it&#x27;s a feature that it seems like mostly OA developers use. So it&#x27;s optional now and we default just to like one version of Postgres or PostGIS for each Postgres cluster. But that functionality was always there. But the extension facility did not grok that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003205---regina"><em>[00:32:05]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#003205---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003205---regina" title="Direct link to 003205---regina">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, and packagers did not grok that either.

Were you only like ten years old then?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000049---alexander"><em>[00:00:49]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#000049---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000049---alexander" title="Direct link to 000049---alexander">â</a></h5><p>Yes, I started actually from web development. Yes. And for web development, Postgres become my favorite database management system. That time there were basically two popular open source database management system, MySQL and Postgres. And Postgres behavior looked way more consistent for me. And this is why Postgres become my favorite. And also thing which attracts my attention was generalized indexing in Postgres that Postgres have even that time had GiST and gene indexes which you could apply to different data types, different search operators. And that was very interesting for me. And I also have studied for PhD in university and I was interested in fuzzy search and features like this. And in Postgres I found fuzzystrmatch complete model. And that model contained Levenshtein function which defines editing distance between two strings, number of editing operations. And I found that it doesn&#x27;t work with multibyte encoding, with multibyte encoding. So it just compares two strings, byte per byte. And my first patch was to just fix this bug. I actually didn&#x27;t know if I could produce the I just downloaded sources. Thankfully that time compiling a Postgres already wasn&#x27;t a problem. So I just had Linux on my desktop and just cloned it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000308---alexander"><em>[00:03:08]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#000308---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000308---alexander" title="Direct link to 000308---alexander">â</a></h5><p>Probably that time it was CVS repository, I cloned it and it wasn&#x27;t difficult to locate the place in the source code responsible for this function. And I just have to find which functions are responsible for getting lengths of multi byte string in Postgres and stuff. Work was very easy, and I have submitted my first patch to Postgres, but then Robert Haas picked my patch to work on it to review and commit. And that time I get that it&#x27;s not so easy this process community, because we have quite long thread studying possible performance regressions and on, and I rewrote patch this small patch many times. But finally we find a way when this patch not only fixes the problem of multibyte encoding, but also doesn&#x27;t produce noticeable overhead when it&#x27;s single byte encoding or strings, just uses single byte characters. In both of these cases, the overhead was negligible. And then Robert did commit my patch.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000440---ry"><em>[00:04:40]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000440---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000440---ry" title="Direct link to 000440---ry">â</a></h5><p>That&#x27;s amazing. Yeah, it&#x27;s interesting. How many lines of code was the patch, I wonder?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000446---alexander"><em>[00:04:46]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#000446---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000446---alexander" title="Direct link to 000446---alexander">â</a></h5><p>I don&#x27;t remember exactly. You could find it on the list, but this patch should be in dozens of lights, probably 20 or something like this, really small. But also with these fix, I started to work on improving this function, improving the performance because if you use the Levenshtein function you are typically looking for strings which are close to your string. Right. And the thing is you basically don&#x27;t care about large distances. For instance, you are looking for strings with editing distance three or less. And that means that if it would be four you don&#x27;t care how much bigger is that distance. And if you need only this, then you could easily, not easily, but you could significantly accelerate function Levenshtein calculation in many times and this functionality took even more work for me and Robert. But you could use it, it&#x27;s Levenshtein less equal. Nice function.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000609---ry"><em>[00:06:09]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000609---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000609---ry" title="Direct link to 000609---ry">â</a></h5><p>That&#x27;s great. Yeah. I also came to Postgres from being a web developer prior and I&#x27;ve realized in recent weeks actually, that the reason why I went to Postgres and not MySQL is primarily I was using Ruby on Rails, which just kind of was Postgres first and then I really didn&#x27;t like PHP. Hopefully you weren&#x27;t a PHP developer, but the lamp stack had MySQL and PHP together and I always just like I don&#x27;t want to go anywhere near anything near PHP. That&#x27;s really not a great reason, but it&#x27;s just a fact.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000648---alexander"><em>[00:06:48]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#000648---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000648---alexander" title="Direct link to 000648---alexander">â</a></h5><p>Yes, probably one of the great feature I have discovered in podcast in early days was DDL transactions. So that if you need to do a database schema migration, you can wrap all the changes into transaction and if something go wrong you can roll. Yes, that&#x27;s just amazing. And it&#x27;s interesting that even old and mature database management systems like Oracle or MSS SQL Server lacks of this functionality. I&#x27;m not sure about the present day, but at time indefinitely they all were lacking and this was very useful.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000736---ry"><em>[00:07:36]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000736---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000736---ry" title="Direct link to 000736---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s great. So you built obviously you started with that first patch and worked on other fuzzy search stuff. Have you worked on any Postgres extensions?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000752---alexander"><em>[00:07:52]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#000752---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000752---alexander" title="Direct link to 000752---alexander">â</a></h5><p>Yes, I continued to work on Postgres. Then I have found that I get known with Oleg and Theodore who was in Russian contributors of Postgres and I get familiar with their work. Some of their work I already know Gist and Jin. But for others work, it was interesting for me that we could accelerate also search for like patterns. Not just perfect patterns, but imagine you looking something that could be in the middle of the string. And there were that time Pgtrgm module. But at that time it only supports trigram similarity. Search using indexes. But I found that it&#x27;s pretty easy if you decompose string with trigrams it&#x27;s pretty easy to implement like search. So you could just extract trigrams from the like patterns and search for them. And thanks that trigrams are extracted all over the string so you can find this substring anywhere. And that time I would say my feeling was just great. So it&#x27;s just amazing. So with quite small patch you could teach database server with some amazing advanced functionality and I get even more encouragement when I would be sorry if I confusing with names hugh Bert I don&#x27;t know the guy from blogger from Poland who was posting to the planet PostgresQL waiting for and he also posted waiting for this feature like Word for Pgtrm.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001015---alexander"><em>[00:10:15]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#001015---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001015---alexander" title="Direct link to 001015---alexander">â</a></h5><p>This was one of my first patches. Another thing that during my PhD research I also researched split algorithms for R3 and I have found more advanced algorithm and I have pushed this algorithm to Postgres core and to PostGIS that took time. Yes, because communities are quite conservatives, but it was also good.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001100---ry"><em>[00:11:00]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001100---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001100---ry" title="Direct link to 001100---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, great. Well, I want to talk about OrioleDB, but before we do that, I was thinking are you paying attention to the whole vector search since you spent so much time on Postgres search features or I don&#x27;t know, at least sometime. I&#x27;m curious, are you kind of tracking what&#x27;s going on with vector search?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001120---alexander"><em>[00:11:20]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#001120---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001120---alexander" title="Direct link to 001120---alexander">â</a></h5><p>Yes. That&#x27;s interesting. That&#x27;s an interesting subject. Yes. While I have researched the split algorithms, I have also experimented with cube concrete model which supported basically multidimensional rectangles of different number of dimensions up to one dimensions. And what I have found is that if you have low dimensionality two, three, four or five, then when you are producing split, your split will be good for one dimension, but almost don&#x27;t differentiate other dimension. So you can imagine this if you have two dimensional space filled with points and you need to split them into two rectangles, there is just two good way to do this split vertically or horizontally. All other ways your rectangles would have a huge overlap. But thing changes when your dimensionality increases. There is a so called Woodman quadratic split algorithm and this algorithm actually do clustering. So it just tries to find to divide the set of points into two clusters. And it doesn&#x27;t work well for low dimensionality, but for high dimensionality of space it becomes better than if you just pick one axis and split in this dimension. And that was interesting for me and I got familiar with cures of dimensions so that if you have low dimensionality space, you can have some guaranteed and quite good search performance.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001336---alexander"><em>[00:13:36]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#001336---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001336---alexander" title="Direct link to 001336---alexander">â</a></h5><p>Right? So imagine the best example is unidimensional space. You can index this just b three and you have some guaranteed or logarithm n time for search for point request. Right? But when you have high dimensionality, that becomes a problem and uniform random data, which could be good, which you could handle very well with low dimensionality, in high dimensionality it becomes almost unindexable. So if you have 1000 of dimension vectors and you need to search for a similarity, then search in uniform data would be almost impossible to accelerate because you can&#x27;t identify which particular dimension could give you a match. You could just eat just cumulative results of cumulative results of all dimensions and it&#x27;s almost impossible to accelerate. I have participated a bit in improvement of PG vector and with some developers of Supabase, we really found that indexing methods, if they applied to uniform data, then they give nothing. So indexing methods, when you have a lot of dimensions, they based on some clustering. The idea is to find, how to say, find the low in the distribution, ununiformity of distribution, and then exploit it. And this is how indexing works. There are different interesting methods for indexing multidimensional space, but I think the favorite is Hnsv method.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001605---alexander"><em>[00:16:05]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#001605---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001605---alexander" title="Direct link to 001605---alexander">â</a></h5><p>And I have read about this method in the scientific paper way before this AI Hype ten years ago.

And the LLM AI, like you said, it&#x27;s kind of blending both sides. Well, that&#x27;s cool. So I wanted to obviously chat about OrioleDB, I imagine. Are you spending trying to spend 100% of your time on OrioleDB, or? It&#x27;s probably hard to I mean, it sounds like there&#x27;s lots of great things happening in Postgres to distract you from your own work.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001657---alexander"><em>[00:16:57]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#001657---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001657---alexander" title="Direct link to 001657---alexander">â</a></h5><p>The thing vector search definitely distract me.

You may be aware it was on top of news and interesting that I have mostly generated this with Chat GPT. So I just wrote the short item list and asked Chat GPT to write me a blog post. Then I have corrected a little bit, then I wrote some graph, then add some graph, asked Chet GPT to add another paragraph with them, and then it was done. And I was curious that I expected that I would be revealed and blamed for this. But actually the comments I get was, oh, this blog post is so much well written.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001823---ry"><em>[00:18:23]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001823---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001823---ry" title="Direct link to 001823---ry">â</a></h5><p>I know, it&#x27;s funny. I agree with you. I&#x27;ll take just like, notes. Like, for example, here I&#x27;ve got like a list of 20 questions that I&#x27;m trying to ask you during this interview, possibly ask you. I guarantee you if I sent this list of 20 questions to ChatGPT and say, hey, make these questions better, it would crush it, give me all kinds of much better questions. But anyway, yeah, I agree. People who aren&#x27;t using it are really missing out on a great assistant. All right, so back to Oriole. What are the top three or four.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001902---alexander"><em>[00:19:02]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#001902---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001902---alexander" title="Direct link to 001902---alexander">â</a></h5><p>Things I&#x27;d like to first say about the thing which bring me to the Oriole? When I have studied Postgres, it was just like a magic how MVCC works. So you can run multiple sessions in parallel and each session will have its own snapshot of the data and that was just amazing. And I was very interested what is under the hood, but how this works from user size was perfect, but I always wondered how it implemented internally. Because when you in progress, when you&#x27;re doing an update, then you just have to mark old tuple and insert the new tuple in the heap. And if hot update is not applied, then you also have to insert all the index tuples even if index set values are not updated. And I wondered if we could do this better. And I think I have this background thoughts for years. So I have studied how MVCC implemented in MySQL as and then how it&#x27;s implemented in Oracle. And it was very interesting for me to get how it&#x27;s implemented in Oracle because I heard that Oracle have block level undo. Yes, and then I have thought how could it be on a block level?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002054---alexander"><em>[00:20:54]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#002054---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002054---alexander" title="Direct link to 002054---alexander">â</a></h5><p>Because if two transaction modifies the same tree page and this page got splitted and then one of transaction could be rolled back, then it&#x27;s not linear list of log records which you could just apply one after another. Because if you need to roll back some change which was before the page split, you need to do some adjustments with it. And then I understood that I need to go deeper and get how it works and then I learn more things, how rider had log working and so on. And I think in 2017 I have started to work on design of my own storage which could work around the most of shortcomings, which I see in Postgres engine. For sure there is no plain wins, in some situation this engine works worse. But I would just like to design some new trade off which could be better in the typical situation. And I can highlight some things in OrioleDB. So the first thing which it is fighting is bloat and in order to eliminate bloat, it has undo log. So if you update a row, then you just have to add a new version of row into the undo chain and you only need to update indexes if their values are updated.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002303---alexander"><em>[00:23:03]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#002303---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002303---alexander" title="Direct link to 002303---alexander">â</a></h5><p>And also indexes are versioned trees as well. In OrioleDB I have heard that it is so in Oracle and I found that this is very attractive idea. Thanks to that index only scan becomes very simple because your secondary index already contains all the information and you doesn&#x27;t need to look into any secondary structures. Because I have heard that in Postgres index only scans, index only scans is amazing until you run in some problem because if you have some intensive workloads and so on, you might have significant part of visibility map zero it and your query could get into trouble. Yes, that also could happen. And this is why I found that if secondary index version that&#x27;s attractive idea and OrioleDB have a mixed underlock containing both row level and block level records and block level records allows to handle some changes like eliminating of dead tuples of the page. So for instance, your page contains some tuples which are deleted but still visible for some transaction. And using block level undo lock you can issue a new version of this page and get rid of all dead rows and reclaim their space. But the transactions which need old version can traverse page level underlock and find the tops that they need and another to eliminate bloat is automatic page merging.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002512---alexander"><em>[00:25:12]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#002512---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002512---alexander" title="Direct link to 002512---alexander">â</a></h5><p>Anyway, if even you have undo lock it could happen that your workload is so that you have a lot of sparse pages so you have a lot of data inserted but then the data was deleted and AudioDB supports automatic merge of sparse page to eliminate bloat. Okay, and you had some questions.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002534---ry"><em>[00:25:34]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002534---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002534---ry" title="Direct link to 002534---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I was just remembering that it was a blog post or a presentation where you like here are the ten worst things about Postgres. I don&#x27;t know the exact phrasing you chose but yeah, basically here are ten problems with Postgres.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002552---alexander"><em>[00:25:52]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#002552---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002552---alexander" title="Direct link to 002552---alexander">â</a></h5><p>That was a blog post of Rick Branson, I hope I spelled the name correctly and yes, I found that was a quite popular blog post. The first popular blog post is definitely Uber blog post about why they moved from Postgres to MySQL. But this blog post from Rick was very interesting for me because the issues he highlighted was very good fit to my vision and to things which I&#x27;m going to improve with OrioleDB.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002636---ry"><em>[00:26:36]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002636---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002636---ry" title="Direct link to 002636---ry">â</a></h5><p>You&#x27;ll probably never be done with OrioleDB because products are never finished, but how&#x27;s your progress been through your target initial list of things you wanted to accomplish with Oriole are you making good progress through that or give us a progress report.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002653---alexander"><em>[00:26:53]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#002653---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002653---alexander" title="Direct link to 002653---alexander">â</a></h5><p>Yes, I&#x27;m making a good progress but currently the main target is not to add new features or handle more things, the current target is stability to get more users. So it doesn&#x27;t work to have amazing products if nobody uses. And I would say that Database World is quite conservative because obviously people don&#x27;t want to lose their data. And this is why, before using some new database technology, you need to ensure that it&#x27;s really stable and mature. And this is the main challenge for new database management system or new storage engine and especially when it&#x27;s OLTP and OrioleDB currently mainly targets OLTP because OLTP is typically the source of your data, right? So where your business operation happened, for instance, OLAP could be not so important. So you pull your data from OLTP system and put to OLAP for analysis and if it will disappear in a OLAP system you can just repeat the procedure but that doesn&#x27;t work for OLTP which is initial source of the data. So this is the main difficulty I think, but we already did very good work with the team, very good work on eliminating the bugs but we definitely need more better testers.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002846---ry"><em>[00:28:46]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002846---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002846---ry" title="Direct link to 002846---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I mean, it&#x27;s a big challenge. It&#x27;s similar for us as well, but you have to create enough differentiation to get people to want to try it. But you can&#x27;t go so far away from like you&#x27;re saying the further the distance is from what they consider stable, the riskier it is. But if you&#x27;re too close to the same thing, there&#x27;s not enough value to do the switch.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002912---alexander"><em>[00:29:12]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#002912---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002912---alexander" title="Direct link to 002912---alexander">â</a></h5><p>Right.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002912---ry"><em>[00:29:12]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002912---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002912---ry" title="Direct link to 002912---ry">â</a></h5><p>So it&#x27;s a tricky catch 22 that you have to do something a little bit dangerous to get the attention. If it&#x27;s too close, then people will be like, if it&#x27;s 10% faster, who cares? Right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002928---alexander"><em>[00:29:28]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#002928---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002928---alexander" title="Direct link to 002928---alexander">â</a></h5><p>Yes, exactly.

We are currently discussing with our team and advisors when we can make market release candidate on the release. At some point, this is just how to say at some point, this is decisions of the will. So there is no strict procedure you can go through and say, okay, your product now should be better, or your product now should be generally available. You just need to decide for yourself and make this decision weighing all the risks.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003030---ry"><em>[00:30:30]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003030---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003030---ry" title="Direct link to 003030---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, it was funny. I&#x27;ll tell you a quick story about that. With my previous company, Astronomer, we were 0.1, 0.2, 0.3. I think we got to like 0.17. And it was like there was nothing big happening in any release that would cause us to say, oh, this should be the 1.0. And then we are also thinking like, this is one of me thinking this, because I was like, let&#x27;s just make the next one 1.0, goddamn it, but let&#x27;s save the 1.0 for a big marketing push. I don&#x27;t know that they ever did it. We waited so long that we never had a 1.0 of that platform. By the time we got to it was like, oh, let&#x27;s rewrite it. I think it&#x27;s a tricky thing to ship, but I&#x27;m a big fan of shipping early and often. And just mark your thing as an RC candidate. It doesn&#x27;t matter. It will attract more attention with that RC dot. That zero dot.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003135---alexander"><em>[00:31:35]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#003135---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003135---alexander" title="Direct link to 003135---alexander">â</a></h5><p>Yes. Actually, the number in the version is marketing you can find in the shop. The price for the good could be $20. But you go away, you come back, and now it&#x27;s $30 crossed $25.01 of advices. I heard about version numbering was never number. If you have new products, never number your version 1.0.0, nobody will trust it&#x27;s stable. So you should number something like 1.3 point eleven.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003221---ry"><em>[00:32:21]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003221---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003221---ry" title="Direct link to 003221---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, I&#x27;m kind of a big fan of CalVer, where the version of your software should be like, how many releases?

Well, I had a bunch of extra little questions I want to ask you just to get to know you a little better. But if you had a magic wand that you could add any feature to Postgres and tomorrow morning we wake up and it&#x27;s there, what would it be? What&#x27;s the most important thing? Or would you be most excited to see?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003306---alexander"><em>[00:33:06]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#003306---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003306---alexander" title="Direct link to 003306---alexander">â</a></h5><p>My question...it could sound probably selfish, but I have a patch set to improve Postgres table access method API. This patch set definitely needs some work and if I magic went I would like this work to be just done and everything is perfect and in the Postgres core perfected.

Yeah, I didn&#x27;t realize how much more Extensible Postgres at least tries to be and has been and how many extensions exist for it. Once you start looking at that list, it&#x27;s pretty amazing, all the work that people have done to extend it.

So if you are adding too many SQL comments and your parser get complicated and parcel state machine cannot fit to processor cache and get slower and your source code also becomes bigger and harder to understand and so on. And finally we are just a group of people which needs to make some decision of will, of where to go. No way is a clear win. We are trying our best to don&#x27;t discourage existing users, but even the best offers of them, even with best efforts of them. There are some disprovements for sure.

Awesome.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="003831---ry"><em>[00:38:31]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003831---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003831---ry" title="Direct link to 003831---ry">â</a></h5><p>Okay, great.

I&#x27;m Ry Walker, founder of Tembo, a managed Postgres company. And today I have Pavlo Golub. Did I say that right? Pavlo? Yeah, you can fix it from Cybertec as my guest. So Pavlo, welcome to the show.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000030---pavlo"><em>[00:00:30]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000030---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000030---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000030---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>Yes, thank you for having me. Hi there.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000032---ry"><em>[00:00:32]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000032---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000032---ry" title="Direct link to 000032---ry">â</a></h5><p>Hi there. Yeah, so maybe you could start by giving us a quick background, like where you grew up and what were you doing before you started working on Postgres.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000041---pavlo"><em>[00:00:41]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000041---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000041---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000041---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>Okay, so I was born in Soviet Union so I&#x27;m a little bit old, but yeah, I lived in Ukraine. And the first time I saw Postgres, when I was in my high school, it was like fourth year of high school and at that time it wasn&#x27;t very popular. Everybody we&#x27;re talking about MySQL like the only database with open source and yeah, at that time I saw the PostgresQL, I tried to install it and run it. It was hard for me to do that because at that time the version was like 7.4 something and at that time there was no installer for Windows and we were mostly like Windows guys at that times. So, yeah, I need to install Linux and then install Postgres. Yeah, I managed to do that, but I wasn&#x27;t happy about it. The whole process is like I feel like cumbersome or something like that. So I left it for like a couple of years and then my first job in IT I was a support guy, so it was directly connected with the Postgres. So I started my IT career with Postgres and I&#x27;m happy that I had this chance.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000236---ry"><em>[00:02:36]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000236---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000236---ry" title="Direct link to 000236---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s crazy. I don&#x27;t personally remember when I first started using Postgres. I think it could have just been when I started using Ruby on Rails, I don&#x27;t know. But it&#x27;s funny, I don&#x27;t remember when I first used Linux or a lot of things, but it&#x27;s great that you have that distinct memory. You started in support, you&#x27;ve built some stuff. Now on top of it, tell me about the body of work you&#x27;ve done on Postgres or with Postgres. I&#x27;m curious to know what you&#x27;ve built.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000313---pavlo"><em>[00:03:13]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000313---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000313---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000313---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>So right now at Cybertec I&#x27;m a consultant, so my position called consultant, they called me consultant, but I prefer to think about myself as a developer. I&#x27;m not an Admin, I&#x27;m not a DBA, I&#x27;m a developer. So I&#x27;m mostly doing developing things for Postgres. I had a couple of small patches to these source, but I don&#x27;t consider them as major things. So I did some client libraries for Delphi if somebody still knows what it is, and later I switched to C, Go, Python, that kind of stuff. And right now I&#x27;m mostly develop with the Go language. And at the moment we have a couple of utilities made in Cybertec, so I&#x27;m in charge of them. So one of them is like pg_timetable, which is a scheduler for PostgresQL, and another is pg_watch which is a monitoring solution for Postgres.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000430---ry"><em>[00:04:30]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000430---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000430---ry" title="Direct link to 000430---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. Yeah. What caught my attention was pg_timetable because I come from a company that my previous company was Apache Airflow. So the idea of doing dags jobs that are chained off of other jobs, to me, there&#x27;s no other way. Trying to schedule jobs and hope that they finish by the time of the next one, that&#x27;s dependent is something that people used to do and they should never, ever do anymore. But I&#x27;m sure it still happens. Right. So certainly if people are using pg_cron, no way to chain them, as far as I can see.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000511---pavlo"><em>[00:05:11]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000511---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000511---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000511---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>We had a client and we have a process, like, lasting, like 14, 15 hours consisting of many steps which are dependent in some complicated ways. So we used a make file to split them into the jobs and to specify that this stage must be executed after that. And that and that worked fine. It&#x27;s cool to have a special utility to run that kind of jobs or chains, whatever.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000556---ry"><em>[00:05:56]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000556---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000556---ry" title="Direct link to 000556---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. Well, one of the things I think about a lot is how Postgres, the Postgres server is doing lots of jobs, right. I don&#x27;t know how many processes it&#x27;s dealing with, someone with better internal knowledges, but I know it&#x27;s certainly vacuuming. It&#x27;s certainly processing queries. It&#x27;s doing a lot of things right. And then question is I&#x27;m a fan of SRP single responsibility principle and programming in general, but I also like monoliths too. We all have conflicting ideas in our heads. And having a queue managed inside the Postgres, you&#x27;re kind of like straddling, right? Because you have a container next to it. So some of the work is happening over there, but some of it is inside of Postgres too. Why not have it all be inside? What are you thinking about for future versions of pg_timetable? Why not just do all the work inside of the running Postgres cluster?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000700---pavlo"><em>[00:07:00]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000700---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000700---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000700---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>So, yeah, thank you for the question because that was like, the second thought when we released the pg_timetable. So the idea is that PostgreSQL uses a separate process for everything. If you have a new connection, you need a new process. So if you have a background worker for cron or for another scheduler, you will need a background worker. A separate process. Yeah. It&#x27;s possible. We can create an extensions with Go. It&#x27;s possible, yes. But right now, I&#x27;m not sure what benefits we will have.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000758---ry"><em>[00:07:58]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000758---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000758---ry" title="Direct link to 000758---ry">â</a></h5><p>It also feels kind of gross, right, to think of throwing it all together. But I have this conversation all the time with my team. If you have a system that&#x27;s dependent on the Postgres, let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s an API, right? And the API, if the Postgres is only invoked when the API happens you could theoretically put all that compute into one bucket and just let the API talk to I&#x27;m thinking, like, say, take it&#x27;s a Rust API. Should you serve that Rust API as a separate container and have the separation of concerns? Or should you just create a custom Postgres extension and let the Rust run inside the Postgres cluster and there&#x27;s zero latency to the data in that regard, but it&#x27;s a little bit of a Frankenapp at that point. It&#x27;s a tricky problem.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000852---pavlo"><em>[00:08:52]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000852---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000852---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000852---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>I will tell you that, that I want to implement this scheduler as an extension for Postgres, not because I think that we will have some benefits, but because this is very interesting task for me as a developer, first of all.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000908---ry"><em>[00:09:08]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000908---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000908---ry" title="Direct link to 000908---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. Is pg_timetable supported by any cloud providers right now?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000916---pavlo"><em>[00:09:16]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000916---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000916---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000916---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, we can run pg_timetable against any cloud provider. If you want, you can run it in Docker and Kubernetes as a standalone binary, or even you can try to grab the source code and put it into this AWS fancy one time run and forget I don&#x27;t remember how they called it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000946---ry"><em>[00:09:46]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000946---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000946---ry" title="Direct link to 000946---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, but because it has the sidecar, it probably can&#x27;t be like a standard extension in RDS, for example.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000954---pavlo"><em>[00:09:54]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000954---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000954---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000954---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>Right, it might be, but I think to make this happen, we need to somehow communicate with AWS and make that happen. It&#x27;s more like politics, not yeah, well.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001010---ry"><em>[00:10:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001010---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001010---ry" title="Direct link to 001010---ry">â</a></h5><p>I think it&#x27;s also just like I don&#x27;t know if any of the other extensions that they offer have a sidecar requirement. Right. So that&#x27;s one of the things we&#x27;re thinking about at Tembo is like, let&#x27;s allow sidecars if you allow sidecars to extensions in our managed service yes. It&#x27;s like, again, it&#x27;s a lot more dangerous in the sense that there&#x27;s more things that could break, but it&#x27;s also more powerful. And if we had the rule that dangerous things are bad and you wouldn&#x27;t have a combustible engine inside of a car where little explosions are happening all the time to power it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001050---pavlo"><em>[00:10:50]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001050---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001050---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001050---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>On the other hand, you can build your own image, right, and somehow to limit the binary in it to do some dangerous things, et cetera.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001102---ry"><em>[00:11:02]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001102---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001102---ry" title="Direct link to 001102---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. I joke sometimes and say we&#x27;re building the dangerous Postgres just because it&#x27;s not really we support 150 extensions now, so it&#x27;s like, yeah, our support footprint is increased and scarier than if you had 75, but I still say it&#x27;s worth it to the developer to have the capability. So I&#x27;d love to get pg_timetable as a standard option. I want to use it, basically. What&#x27;s funny is I&#x27;m building a data warehouse right now for our company, and I started with pg_cron, and I have these four jobs that all start at the same time and it&#x27;s very early, so it&#x27;s not a problem. But I would love to have them be chained. Like I said, I could do that fake with some spacing things out, but I really feel like I&#x27;ve just stepped back 20 years into the world of early data processing. So I appreciate what you built and use it soon.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001208---pavlo"><em>[00:12:08]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001208---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001208---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001208---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>Okay. Let me know if you&#x27;re happy with it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001211---ry"><em>[00:12:11]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001211---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001211---ry" title="Direct link to 001211---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think it&#x27;s a good idea and it could also help developers avoid having to go pick up some other tool to take the next stage of their data processing, which to me is a big win. And we&#x27;re trying to make the Meme &quot;Postgres for everything.&quot; I know you are too, in a sense, because you built the extension. But yeah, I think there&#x27;s so much it can do, and it can do a lot more than just writing and reading data.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001254---pavlo"><em>[00:12:54]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001254---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001254---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001254---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>One more thing about having the pg_timetable as an external application is that you can use your own binaries inside jobs like baseql or pg_dump or something, like to grab something, to convert something, et cetera. So we want to have a possibility for developers to create their own docker images with the binaries or tools they only need and pg_timetable. So in this way it sounds like a Swiss knife, right? So I need a pg_timetable and a couple of utilities for grabbing something to manipulate with files, et cetera. And then we pack it and that&#x27;s all. We don&#x27;t need to think how we should allow the application to install it or to have it on the system version, et cetera, et cetera.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001358---ry"><em>[00:13:58]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001358---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001358---ry" title="Direct link to 001358---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, basically what you&#x27;re saying is it gets even more dangerous quickly, right? Like the base use case is one thing, but then when people start doing some more wild things, including their own, it could be their own packages, right? Their own, of course, completely custom. Nobody knows what&#x27;s inside of it. It could be a bitcoin miner, it could be anything, right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001423---pavlo"><em>[00:14:23]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001423---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001423---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001423---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001426---ry"><em>[00:14:26]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001426---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001426---ry" title="Direct link to 001426---ry">â</a></h5><p>Are you working on the next version of it or is it pretty stable right now and doesn&#x27;t require a lot?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001432---pavlo"><em>[00:14:32]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001432---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001432---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001432---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>So at the moment we are stable. So we are open for ideas and then requests, et cetera. But at the moment we are fine, I believe. So it&#x27;s like in maintenance mode, so we update versions, packages, et cetera. So no new box. I&#x27;m happy with it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001456---ry"><em>[00:14:56]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001456---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001456---ry" title="Direct link to 001456---ry">â</a></h5><p>Did you build it?

So I was trying to learn a new language to see how can I do this? And we are now here.

Was it hard to, for example, understand internals or was that part easy? I&#x27;m kind of curious what was toughest.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001549---pavlo"><em>[00:15:49]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001549---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001549---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001549---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>For me, I would say that the new tools that you need to use, like if you are familiar with your favorite IDE and then for Go language, you need to switch to something like Vs code or Go land or whatever. This is completely new tool for you. And you have no this muscular memory for shortcuts, et cetera, et cetera. It&#x27;s kind of difficult. Like six months I was trying to get used to new tooling, but after that I&#x27;m pretty happy.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001626---ry"><em>[00:16:26]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001626---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001626---ry" title="Direct link to 001626---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s so when was it that you started working on timetable? pg_timetable?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001635---pavlo"><em>[00:16:35]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001635---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001635---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001635---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>Maybe three years ago, something like that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001639---ry"><em>[00:16:39]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001639---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001639---ry" title="Direct link to 001639---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. Okay, well, that&#x27;s great. So have you guys implemented it many times now for customers or how has it been? I know it&#x27;s not a commercial product, but I assume it should be helping the consulting business, right? Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001658---pavlo"><em>[00:16:58]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001658---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001658---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001658---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>So it usually goes in a package with something. Usually if we have a new client, we are talking about high availability and we are talking about monitoring, and we are talking about that and that, and then we say, okay, we have a scheduler if you want it, and usually people want it. I don&#x27;t remember we have like a standalone cell for a pg_timetable. But yeah, it&#x27;s usually like packaged into something bigger, usually with a high availability and monitoring.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001733---ry"><em>[00:17:33]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001733---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001733---ry" title="Direct link to 001733---ry">â</a></h5><p>Got it. Itâs like a sweetener, right? Cool. Well, maybe I&#x27;ll shift into some more general topics. I&#x27;d love to know what are some of the developments in Postgres ecosystem that you&#x27;re excited about?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001750---pavlo"><em>[00:17:50]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001750---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001750---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001750---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>So the Postgres itself, the core, I always want to constantly want to do something for the core, but.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001803---ry"><em>[00:18:03]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001803---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001803---ry" title="Direct link to 001803---ry">â</a></h5><p>It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re racking your brain around there.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001807---pavlo"><em>[00:18:07]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001807---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001807---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001807---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>The process itself is not like user friendly. First of all, you need to communicate through the email lists. No GitHub, no issues, no pull requests. And you need constantly update your patches because the development is very active, and you need to defend your patch against many people in the community because why you did it, what purpose, why you do it that way, not another. So that might take some time for.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001846---ry"><em>[00:18:46]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001846---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001846---ry" title="Direct link to 001846---ry">â</a></h5><p>Who are your favorite people in the Postgres ecosystem?

Well, I think that the community is the reason, number one, why I am still doing Postgres things. I was working like, for five years without knowing nobody from the community. And then in 2011, I was first time on the PG conference in Europe, in Amsterdam, and that changed my mind. Absolutely. I saw what the community is and what are the main things and why are those working that way and not another. So if you want names, so Bruce Momjian, for sure. Magnus Hagander, Ilya Kosmodemiansky, Vik Fearing, Andreas Scherbaum, a lot of them. Like LÃ¦titia Avrot . A lot of them.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001959---ry"><em>[00:19:59]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001959---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001959---ry" title="Direct link to 001959---ry">â</a></h5><p>Well, I&#x27;ll reach out to those people. It&#x27;s obviously a very big community too, certainly, considering the extent, anyone who&#x27;s touching it is very excited. First, I&#x27;m going to the know, the New York City conference here in a couple of months. Yeah. So I&#x27;m excited to meet a bunch of people there. And we went to an event in San Jose last spring, which was fun. All right, so here&#x27;s another one. If you had a magic wand and you could add any feature to Postgres? What would you change about it or what would you add?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002039---pavlo"><em>[00:20:39]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#002039---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002039---pavlo" title="Direct link to 002039---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>I don&#x27;t think that I can change something in a way that it will be a brick and change but I would like to see if we can implement Postgres using threads, not the processes. I would like to see if that might be better solution that we have now. I&#x27;m not sure.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002104---ry"><em>[00:21:04]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002104---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002104---ry" title="Direct link to 002104---ry">â</a></h5><p>It&#x27;s being debated, right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002107---pavlo"><em>[00:21:07]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#002107---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002107---pavlo" title="Direct link to 002107---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, absolutely.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002108---ry"><em>[00:21:08]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002108---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002108---ry" title="Direct link to 002108---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, we&#x27;ll see.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002109---pavlo"><em>[00:21:09]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#002109---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002109---pavlo" title="Direct link to 002109---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>It&#x27;s a hot topic.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002110---ry"><em>[00:21:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002110---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002110---ry" title="Direct link to 002110---ry">â</a></h5><p>Hot topic, yeah. I did join the mailing list for a short period of time. I&#x27;m starting a company too and it just was too much. I was like, oh my gosh, this is a fire hose and someday I want to be able to have the time to consume it. But today wasn&#x27;t that day. Is there anything about Postgres that no one agrees with you about? Do you have any contrarian views about any part of it that you can think of?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002138---pavlo"><em>[00:21:38]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#002138---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002138---pavlo" title="Direct link to 002138---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, probably my views about the Windows because I was a Windows guy and I&#x27;m still a Windows guy and I&#x27;m always saying that we need to support Windows as well as we support Linux. So that means installers for Windows and extensions and tools, et cetera, et cetera. And people usually say, no, Linux is fine and that&#x27;s enough is enough.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002208---ry"><em>[00:22:08]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002208---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002208---ry" title="Direct link to 002208---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, it&#x27;s interesting, it&#x27;s fun. I&#x27;m interested in a lot of different areas of programming. I was looking at, say, Unity, you know, game development and it&#x27;s C# and I&#x27;m like &quot;Ugh&quot; and it seems like very Windows centric and I&#x27;m like because I&#x27;m a Mac user and whatever. For me it&#x27;d be like Mac, Linux, Windows in terms of my priority but I&#x27;m like certainly not C#, right? But anyway, yeah, the religious wars will never end there, I guess, in terms of platforms.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002247---pavlo"><em>[00:22:47]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#002247---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002247---pavlo" title="Direct link to 002247---pavlo">â</a></h5><p>The bad thing about our approach right now that I think that we don&#x27;t have enough good GUI programs for PostgreSQL every time we are using psql to show something to demo. And I think that for newbies it would be much easier to follow a demonstration if you use some fancy GUI application.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002315---ry"><em>[00:23:15]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002315---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002315---ry" title="Direct link to 002315---ry">â</a></h5><p>Well, it was great chatting.

I mean, Eric Ridge is pretty much a household name in mean, in case there&#x27;s someone listening who doesn&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve been working on. You want to give us a quick background on your involvement in postgres over the years?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000036---eric"><em>[00:00:36]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000036---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000036---eric" title="Direct link to 000036---eric">â</a></h5><p>I think a household name is absolutely not true. First of all, I&#x27;m Eric. I am the reason that this postgres extension name ZomboDB exists. And over the years of developing that, something that&#x27;s now called Pgrx kind of fell out of all that work that lets us develop extensions for postgres using the Rust programming language. And these things have been where my interest has been as it relates to postgres. I guess past seven, eight years now. Things ZomboDB has been out since 2015, so we&#x27;re right at eight years.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000114---ry"><em>[00:01:14]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000114---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000114---ry" title="Direct link to 000114---ry">â</a></h5><p>Do you know how many it&#x27;s at? An uncountable number of Rust extensions now, probably you probably at one point knew how many there were, but now you&#x27;ve lost track.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000124---eric"><em>[00:01:24]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000124---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000124---eric" title="Direct link to 000124---eric">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s a good question. It&#x27;s hard to know. There&#x27;s no real clearinghouse around extensions.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000130---ry"><em>[00:01:30]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000130---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000130---ry" title="Direct link to 000130---ry">â</a></h5><p>If only there was, that would be a great thing for someone to build.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000133---eric"><em>[00:01:33]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000133---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000133---eric" title="Direct link to 000133---eric">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, it would. I wish somebody would get on that. Right. Yeah, that&#x27;s a good question. There&#x27;s some bigger names using Pgrx, and the Timescale is one. Supabase is one. We recently released plrust, and that&#x27;s found its way out on RDS. So that&#x27;s exciting for us. What we see popping up are small extensions that are written in Pgrx, and we see a lot of people writing I don&#x27;t want to call them one off extensions, but one off extensions that are just, like, specific to their business use case and solve some interesting data domain problem that only they would have. But now they have the ability to build that business logic or data manipulation or what have you into their database and into the database itself.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000227---ry"><em>[00:02:27]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000227---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000227---ry" title="Direct link to 000227---ry">â</a></h5><p>Without having to go find a C programmer that&#x27;s willing to do such work.

And that was one of the motivators for developing Pgrx, was I guess I had been working on postgres extensions in some form or fashion since postgres 8.0, and I think that was even before the extension packaging and create extension command and all that came into existence not long before. But I think that that was before and yeah, I mean, just over the years, I got tired of working in C. When you&#x27;re developing a postgres extension in C, you&#x27;re not only putting on your C programmer hat, but you&#x27;re trying to put on the hat of a postgres hacker. Right. You need to understand postgres sources just as much as you do the language itself. So Rust was becoming a popular a number of years ago. So I was like, you know what, I&#x27;m going to try to do this.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000322---ry"><em>[00:03:22]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000322---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000322---ry" title="Direct link to 000322---ry">â</a></h5><p>Well, it&#x27;s interesting. It&#x27;s like how a lot of games, if they have mods, the language for the mods has to be easier than the language for the core game. Right. So a game might be written in something like Unity, but then they give you, like, Lua as a tool or JavaScript or something simple to build. But in Postgres, that wasn&#x27;t true. Now, is Rust as simple as Lua or JavaScript? Maybe not, but it&#x27;s still like very beloved people who try to learn it. In my experience so far, it&#x27;s 100% like anyone who tries to learn Rust learns it and loves it. I haven&#x27;t found someone yet and I have a small sample size, but, yeah, seems like it&#x27;s a pretty good hit rate in terms of the perfect mix of control and speed with the ease of onboarding.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000410---eric"><em>[00:04:10]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000410---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000410---eric" title="Direct link to 000410---eric">â</a></h5><p>If you&#x27;re not a C programmer, then writing the postgres extension in C is going to be difficult again, because C and then also because you&#x27;re really programming Postgres&#x27;s version of C, which is great, but it&#x27;s not JavaScript, it&#x27;s not Ruby, it&#x27;s not Java. If you&#x27;re not a Rust programmer, first you&#x27;ve got to learn Rust, and Rust is different enough from all the other languages to make that a point. But what we&#x27;re trying to do with Pgrx, and it&#x27;s going to be a multi year effort to do this, it may never get done, but we&#x27;re trying to present the postgres internals in the most idiomatic way possible to Rust. Right. So that if you are a Rust programmer or you are beginning to learn Rust, it&#x27;ll be pretty obvious what you need to do in order to make your postgres extension useful.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000510---ry"><em>[00:05:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000510---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000510---ry" title="Direct link to 000510---ry">â</a></h5><p>So you said you were working on extensions as early as Postgres Eight. Were you a Postgres user or our developer even earlier than that, or was that sort of when you got involved?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000521---eric"><em>[00:05:21]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000521---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000521---eric" title="Direct link to 000521---eric">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, Postgres user, I think we started using Postgres at work in the year 2000 and that might have been I mean, is that 7.1, 7.2? It&#x27;s quite a long time ago and we&#x27;ve been using it every day since. And, yeah, somewhere along the way we needed to do some work inside the database. So here we are today.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000546---ry"><em>[00:05:46]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000546---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000546---ry" title="Direct link to 000546---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. For me, when I think about when did I start using Postgres, it&#x27;s like thinking about when did I first start using a laptop, it&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t remember exactly when, but definitely transitioned to having a laptop at some point. But, yeah, it didn&#x27;t seem monumental to start using Postgres back then, but obviously it&#x27;s come a long way and it&#x27;s a pretty exciting ecosystem right now. So, yeah. What do you think the most powerful thing about extensions are? Do you have any thoughts on what are the most powerful things you can do with extensions, out of curiosity?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000619---eric"><em>[00:06:19]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000619---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000619---eric" title="Direct link to 000619---eric">â</a></h5><p>It&#x27;s an interesting question.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000621---ry"><em>[00:06:21]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000621---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000621---ry" title="Direct link to 000621---ry">â</a></h5><p>What&#x27;s the coolest part of, I guess what API? Or maybe another good question is what hasn&#x27;t been exposed yet that should be or needs to be in Pgrx? That would be powerful.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000632---eric"><em>[00:06:32]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000632---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000632---eric" title="Direct link to 000632---eric">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I&#x27;ll start there and then work backwards. There&#x27;s a lot of internal APIs within Postgres, and there&#x27;s a number of interesting ones. There&#x27;s the index access method API, which is really easy to implement. We haven&#x27;t added safe wrappers around that to Pgrx, but it&#x27;s real easy to implement. It&#x27;s really just a handful of functions. There&#x27;s the Foreign Data Wrapper API, which Supabase released a project that they call Wrappers that&#x27;ll let you create foreign data wrappers using Rust backed up by Pgrx. So kind of the next big API around that genre of internals. There would be the Table Access Method APIs, and we haven&#x27;t exposed these at all yet. They&#x27;re actually difficult to get at even through our bindings just because of the way they&#x27;re set up in the postgres sources. So when we get around to doing that, and I hope that we will, there&#x27;s going to be some development effort on our part to safely expose these or safely expose the Table Access Method APIs. But that&#x27;s the API that would let you write your own heap storage engineer system in Rust.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000749---ry"><em>[00:07:49]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000749---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000749---ry" title="Direct link to 000749---ry">â</a></h5><p>Tell me about I mean, probably not everybody knows what ZomboDB is.

If you don&#x27;t remember it, then that just means you weren&#x27;t playing on the internet. You&#x27;re probably doing real work. It still exists so listeners can go and check it out, but the name just came from that. So ZomboDB is a postgres extension, and it&#x27;s been through numerous iterations over the past eight years, but it has always been postgres extension that lets you create an index on a table that&#x27;s backed by Elasticsearch. Typically the usage pattern is you create the index indexing all of the columns in the table and you point it to an Elasticsearch endpoint over Http or Https, and the ZomboDB keeps that index up to date. It keeps the index MVCC correct. All of your search results are you only see results that would otherwise be visible within the executing transaction has its own query language for doing full text queries, so users don&#x27;t have to learn the Elasticsearch query DSL, which is pretty intense.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000914---ry"><em>[00:09:14]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000914---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000914---ry" title="Direct link to 000914---ry">â</a></h5><p>Can you use the Elasticsearch DSL with it, though?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000917---eric"><em>[00:09:17]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000917---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000917---eric" title="Direct link to 000917---eric">â</a></h5><p>You can, and there&#x27;s a number of ways to do that. The query language itself allows you to just insert as part of an expression. You can insert a JSON block to represent a query DSL node. There&#x27;s a full set of SQL builder functions, so you can build query DSL through SQL statements. You can mix and match these things together. It&#x27;s pretty sophisticated on that front, and it also exposes nearly all of Elasticsearch&#x27;s aggregate endpoints to enable you to do really interesting aggregations with your full text. And since all the fields of a table are also stored in the Elasticsearch index, you can do some really interesting things that involve full text queries and aggregating on various metadata fields and do all this with a large distributed elastic search cluster behind the scenes and do it in near real time. It&#x27;s really slick. The downside to ZomboDB is that you now have an Elastic search cluster running alongside your postgres cluster. And ES is a living breathing system. It requires significant attention and maintenance in production. It gives you a lot of capabilities to scale out horizontally very easily, but it is its own living breathing system there.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001042---ry"><em>[00:10:42]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001042---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001042---ry" title="Direct link to 001042---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, it&#x27;d be great if you can build a version of this without requiring elastic.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001046---eric"><em>[00:10:46]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#001046---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001046---eric" title="Direct link to 001046---eric">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I know a guy that&#x27;s working on that.

Once we kind of got ZomboDB working, we were like, whoa, it&#x27;s really amazing what you can do with this and how easy it is to use. And one of the mantras from Zombo.com is the only limit is yourself.

Our industry is ediscovery litigation support and among many other areas within that domain, searching large volumes of text is a key thing.

I guess, to our users. Users, it&#x27;s much more than just a search box. They can search by particular fields and design proximity queries, and they can do term lookups. They can create real time dashboards and whatnot through our software. That&#x27;s all backed by ZomboDB. One interesting use case is in the world of litigation. The plaintiffs will provide the defendants with a list of keywords that need to be searched in order to find documents that are responsive to particular to these topics. And these keywords are sometimes just literally a keyword one word. Sometimes they&#x27;re phrases, sometimes they&#x27;re wild card terms. Sometimes they&#x27;re phrases with embedded wildcards. Sometimes they&#x27;re patterns that need to be recognized. And so, like an analytics side of what we use ZomboDB for is taking these ginormous lists of things and kicking it off and getting back a list of the 6 million documents out of the 200 million that might match this set of keywords that the plaintiffs have requested production for.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001425---ry"><em>[00:14:25]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001425---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001425---ry" title="Direct link to 001425---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s intense.

ZomboDB does integrate with it, but the data world that I live in doesn&#x27;t involve the need to do geographical type queries. But I&#x27;ve always been really impressed with it. I think the postgres foreign data wrapper as an extension is really great, and that comes from the core community, but pretty impressed with that. Citus has always been interesting to me. I guess they&#x27;ve long since been bought out by Microsoft and are still going strong. I think that Citus really shows off the power of what a postgres extension can do, and it also shows off the power of having committers on the hackers and hackers to be able to help move the extension system in postgres forward so that you can then implement something like Citus on top of it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001536---ry"><em>[00:15:36]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001536---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001536---ry" title="Direct link to 001536---ry">â</a></h5><p>When they were building that, did they have to add things to extensions in order to build that?

But yeah, one of the things that we&#x27;re focused on right now is I guess it&#x27;s two things kind of concurrently. One is we&#x27;re improving Pgrx, is testing fundamentals, and it&#x27;s both tying in more interesting things in CI like Valgrind, to different approaches to unit testing, which includes we&#x27;re doing a big push on property testing right now within Pgrx. I think there&#x27;s going to be some pull request landing in the next week or so with that. And we&#x27;re also focused on improving some of the memory safety and soundness impedance mismatches between Postgres internals and Rust&#x27;s compiler. So it&#x27;s a big concerted effort to take a look at these issues.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001925---ry"><em>[00:19:25]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001925---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001925---ry" title="Direct link to 001925---ry">â</a></h5><p>Well, it seems like contributing to Pgrx could be like a gateway drug towards getting closer to helping with postgres itself. Right. Because you need to understand the internals to do anything in know, at least unless you&#x27;re working on tests or yeah, I mean in general, adding new features to Pgrx means understanding postgres well enough to create that interface, which is big challenge.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001948---eric"><em>[00:19:48]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#001948---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001948---eric" title="Direct link to 001948---eric">â</a></h5><p>It does. And we myself and the others that on the decor development team there, we spend probably as much time in the postgres sources as we do actually writing code for it in.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002003---ry"><em>[00:20:03]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002003---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002003---ry" title="Direct link to 002003---ry">â</a></h5><p>You guys.

Excited to chat with you today. How many postgres extensions have you authored in 2023?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000023---adam"><em>[00:00:23]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000023---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000023---adam" title="Direct link to 000023---adam">â</a></h5><p>Oh, it at least two.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000028---ry"><em>[00:00:28]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000028---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000028---ry" title="Direct link to 000028---ry">â</a></h5><p>At least two?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000029---adam"><em>[00:00:29]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000029---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000029---adam" title="Direct link to 000029---adam">â</a></h5><p>Well, in early 2023, I was just like, getting started and trying to figure out how to write one. And I know I wrote like a handful of them that didn&#x27;t really do anything. I think the first one was just put like a rest server inside an extension and see what happens. Kind of didn&#x27;t work very well.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000057---ry"><em>[00:00:57]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000057---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000057---ry" title="Direct link to 000057---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I remember that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000059---adam"><em>[00:00:59]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000059---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000059---adam" title="Direct link to 000059---adam">â</a></h5><p>I think I made like, a prometheus exporter, and then recently there were two ones that are kind of more useful.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000105---ry"><em>[00:01:05]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000105---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000105---ry" title="Direct link to 000105---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s great. Well, so obviously we know each other. We both worked together at Tembo. I mean, I could ask you questions as if I don&#x27;t already know the answers, but since I do, I&#x27;m not going to do that. I was going to say getting into postgres, though, joining Tembo wasn&#x27;t your first touch of postgres. Do you remember starting with, like I can&#x27;t really quite remember when I started. But can you remember when you did?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000133---adam"><em>[00:01:33]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000133---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000133---adam" title="Direct link to 000133---adam">â</a></h5><p>Well, the first time I heard of postgres I&#x27;m pretty sure was like in undergrad, like database management systems class. And it was like, there&#x27;s Oracle, there&#x27;s these companies around it, and then there&#x27;s open source stuff, postgresQL, you know? And I remember thinking, like, oh, that&#x27;s And I probably Googled it and saw the elephant. And then I know I started using it in undergrad. I was doing some scientific computing stuff and I just needed somewhere to I didn&#x27;t want to just keep writing to CSVs. I wanted to put it somewhere that was easier to search. And I just used postgres for it. Didn&#x27;t really know what I was doing. It was just like, dump it into this database.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000221---ry"><em>[00:02:21]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000221---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000221---ry" title="Direct link to 000221---ry">â</a></h5><p>Nice, nice. And then as far as hacking postgres, that just started recently, or have you messed with the internals of postgres prior to this year?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000235---adam"><em>[00:02:35]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000235---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000235---adam" title="Direct link to 000235---adam">â</a></h5><p>Definitely not prior to this year. It&#x27;s mostly focused on the application layer, building stuff on top of postgres. This year still getting deeper into the internals of postgres. I had installed some extensions before this year. Definitely didn&#x27;t even think about how do you write build an extension, but it&#x27;s.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000300---ry"><em>[00:03:00]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000300---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000300---ry" title="Direct link to 000300---ry">â</a></h5><p>Pretty easy to build them?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000301---adam"><em>[00:03:01]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000301---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000301---adam" title="Direct link to 000301---adam">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s very recent for me.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000302---ry"><em>[00:03:02]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000302---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000302---ry" title="Direct link to 000302---ry">â</a></h5><p>Pretty easy to build them. Right. Would you say?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000304---adam"><em>[00:03:04]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000304---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000304---adam" title="Direct link to 000304---adam">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. A shallow one is easy if you can learn rust. Yeah, it&#x27;s a challenge. I think it&#x27;s hard.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000317---ry"><em>[00:03:17]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000317---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000317---ry" title="Direct link to 000317---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I was kind of kidding.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000319---adam"><em>[00:03:19]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000319---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000319---adam" title="Direct link to 000319---adam">â</a></h5><p>And then there&#x27;s like a learning curve, and then once you get over a curve, you can kind of get moving with it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000327---ry"><em>[00:03:27]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000327---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000327---ry" title="Direct link to 000327---ry">â</a></h5><p>Maybe. Let&#x27;s talk about the extensions that you&#x27;re, I guess, most proud of or have the most traction so far. What are those?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000339---adam"><em>[00:03:39]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000339---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000339---adam" title="Direct link to 000339---adam">â</a></h5><p>Pgmq, I think, has the most traction message queue extension. It&#x27;s a lot like SQS Amazon&#x27;s simple Queue service or Redisimple Message queue except on postgres. Well, we wrote it for Tembo to help run our cloud. We needed a message queue between Control Plane and Data Plane, so we wrote it for that. And then just in the last couple of months, we started kind of talking about it in the community. And after we wrote a blog about it, we&#x27;ve had a few people from the community that didn&#x27;t know before who are now consistently contributing to the project. So Pgmq is definitely the one that I think has most traction.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000436---ry"><em>[00:04:36]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000436---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000436---ry" title="Direct link to 000436---ry">â</a></h5><p>And I think you&#x27;re also working on well, you kind of have a stack of them, right? Because your other extension relies on Pgmq. True?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000448---adam"><em>[00:04:48]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000448---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000448---adam" title="Direct link to 000448---adam">â</a></h5><p>PG later.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000450---ry"><em>[00:04:50]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000450---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000450---ry" title="Direct link to 000450---ry">â</a></h5><p>Is that true?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000451---adam"><em>[00:04:51]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000451---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000451---adam" title="Direct link to 000451---adam">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. Okay. Yeah, PG later, that&#x27;s another extension that lets you submit a query to Postgres and then forget about it and come back later and see the results from that query. And that&#x27;s built on top of Pgmq. So it&#x27;s like a stack of extensions.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000520---ry"><em>[00:05:20]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000520---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000520---ry" title="Direct link to 000520---ry">â</a></h5><p>Nice. I guess you&#x27;re in the position now to be the extension mentor for others in the company who may be building extensions.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000529---adam"><em>[00:05:29]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000529---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000529---adam" title="Direct link to 000529---adam">â</a></h5><p>I know.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000529---ry"><em>[00:05:29]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000529---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000529---ry" title="Direct link to 000529---ry">â</a></h5><p>I just hired a co op who&#x27;s working on one, and I imagine you&#x27;re mentoring him to some degree.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000537---adam"><em>[00:05:37]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000537---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000537---adam" title="Direct link to 000537---adam">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, Jay talking about? Yeah, Jay&#x27;s. Great. Hey, Jay. Jay, if you&#x27;re listening yeah. Jay&#x27;s been working on the another extension written in Rust, Clerk FDW. So it&#x27;s a foreign data wrapper around Clerk, which is like our identity provider. We just want to be able to build this data warehouse that has our users and their organizations and have that data persisted in our data warehouse. So we built well, Jay is building that foreign data wrapper around Clerk, which is pretty cool.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000617---ry"><em>[00:06:17]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000617---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000617---ry" title="Direct link to 000617---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, we probably should give a shout out to Supabase for the Wrappers project that we&#x27;re using to build that with. Sounds like it&#x27;s been a pretty nice experience. Jay&#x27;s a co op that just joined, like, last week and so already being very productive. So I&#x27;m excited. I think that there&#x27;s the possibility of an explosion of new extensions for Postgres now that Pgrx allows us to use Rust. You agree with that?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000651---adam"><em>[00:06:51]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000651---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000651---adam" title="Direct link to 000651---adam">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty powerful because take this Clerk FDW, that extension that Jay&#x27;s building. We can bootstrap the software together the same way as you might do outside of Postgres, but we don&#x27;t have to spin up another resource somewhere, manage a pod or another VM, can package it up into an extension, use Supabase Wrapper. So that&#x27;s a software that&#x27;s already built. It&#x27;s tested. We don&#x27;t have to reinvent the wheel on that. We write the extension in Rust. So we pull in Rust libraries that are already built, already tested. Then we write our own tests on top of these things and then package it into our extension and then deploy it as part of the database. And then we can kind of just monitor the data there and not have to manage another service that could crash.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000754---ry"><em>[00:07:54]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000754---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000754---ry" title="Direct link to 000754---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, it&#x27;s pretty nice. So I was going to change a little bit to...you&#x27;ve also been using a lot of other people&#x27;s extensions. Again, probably a lot more since joining Tembo than before, but what are some of your, I don&#x27;t know, favorite extensions that you&#x27;ve been exposed to?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000815---adam"><em>[00:08:15]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000815---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000815---adam" title="Direct link to 000815---adam">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, you said PG Cron a few different places. There&#x27;s another extension that I&#x27;m working on. It&#x27;s, like, really early, but it&#x27;s kind of wrapping up kind of some of the stuff that Langchain does in Python, but wrapping it up into an extension, pulling in PG vector into that, pulling in pg_cron, pulls in Pgmq and PostgresML as well. So it&#x27;s like a bootstrapped extension. So all of those are pretty good PostgresML, pg_cron, pgvector, and they all have pretty good docs, so you can get up and running with them quickly and kind of figure out what you need to do.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000909---ry"><em>[00:09:09]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000909---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000909---ry" title="Direct link to 000909---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. So have you found that you&#x27;ve had to study the internals of postgres much as part of the process of building these extensions?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000923---adam"><em>[00:09:23]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000923---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000923---adam" title="Direct link to 000923---adam">â</a></h5><p>Not really too much. Only when I&#x27;m having trouble getting it up and running for the first time do I need to really look at postgres. But a lot of these extensions don&#x27;t. They&#x27;re not like touching with hooks into and replacing core functionality of postgres. They&#x27;re extending things. So a lot of what PostgresML does is just give you functions that go off and make rest calls or download data from elsewhere in the Internet and put it in your database for you, give you access to some pre trained machine learning models. And it&#x27;s not changing fundamentally how postgres runs. It&#x27;s still like the normal postgres. It&#x27;s kind of like a layer on top of yeah. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001019---ry"><em>[00:10:19]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001019---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001019---ry" title="Direct link to 001019---ry">â</a></h5><p>I think some extensions can do surgery and some are, know, laying on top of and not messing with the core functionality.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001028---adam"><em>[00:10:28]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001028---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001028---adam" title="Direct link to 001028---adam">â</a></h5><p>Right? Yeah, it&#x27;s an area I&#x27;m kind of new with that, so I haven&#x27;t gotten super deep into replacing core functionality of postgres quite yet. But soon we&#x27;ll probably start working in that space a little bit more.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001047---ry"><em>[00:10:47]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001047---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001047---ry" title="Direct link to 001047---ry">â</a></h5><p>What&#x27;s, like the testing story? If you&#x27;re a dev that likes to write TDD, test driven development, are you able to do that with extensions in particular, I guess, with Pgrx. What&#x27;s the test driven story there look like?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001103---adam"><em>[00:11:03]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001103---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001103---adam" title="Direct link to 001103---adam">â</a></h5><p>Pgrx, I think, is pretty good. They have a way for you to say unit test or integration test for the extension that you&#x27;re writing, so you can say, execute some queries and then make assertions on the outputs of those queries. So kind of like, have normal assertions that you would do in whatever language that you&#x27;re testing. Pgrx has some tooling around like, oh, I want to spin up postgres 15.3, spin up a new environment for that, install your extension into it, and then run your test suite on it. Yeah, I guess it can get a little bit trickier, I think could be because depending on how complex the extension is, you could have system dependencies, um, like, oh, I need a specific version of GCC or something, or OpenSSL version something has to be installed. I haven&#x27;t really quite found a good way to test all of those things to make it super portable to say, like, yep, all these test pass. And that means my extension is just good for everybody.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001228---ry"><em>[00:12:28]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001228---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001228---ry" title="Direct link to 001228---ry">â</a></h5><p>For the test running on your local machine. I know they&#x27;re running on your local machine, but in a docker container or just natively.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001241---adam"><em>[00:12:41]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001241---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001241---adam" title="Direct link to 001241---adam">â</a></h5><p>You could do both, I guess. Kind of like my workflow for it. I guess I would do, like, run the test locally and then have the extension in a GitHub repo and have a CI pipeline that runs the same tests, but in Docker or within a GitHub workflow to be like, hey, before you merge this, you need to pass all these tests, kind of gate yourself a little bit.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001310---ry"><em>[00:13:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001310---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001310---ry" title="Direct link to 001310---ry">â</a></h5><p>That&#x27;s great. Well, cool. So I was going to ask, as far as your background prior to Tembo, you were doing little ML engineering too. Did you use postgres much in that role? I guess the question is, did you use any of the special parts of Postgres or was it really just like a standard transactional store with little knowledge of the extension ecosystem?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001339---adam"><em>[00:13:39]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001339---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001339---adam" title="Direct link to 001339---adam">â</a></h5><p>Nothing too crazy. I&#x27;ve always tried to do a queue on postgres, so be like, build up this giant queue of things that a machine learning model needs to make predictions on, or make a bunch of different predictions, dump them into a queue, and then have another process. Look at all these predictions and pick the best one before giving it back to the user. But a lot of OLTP like high transaction workloads in kind of machine learning space. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001418---ry"><em>[00:14:18]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001418---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001418---ry" title="Direct link to 001418---ry">â</a></h5><p>So you said you&#x27;ve been trying to build queues historically, a lot of times in bigger companies, there are less tools for various tasks. For example, use redis if you want to build a queue, or use snowflake if you want to build a data warehouse. I don&#x27;t even know that these things were officially declared by any sort of powers that be. It&#x27;s more like the sales reps at those companies decided that this company is going to be a salesforce company or a snowflake company. Right. It&#x27;s kind of a slow boil that you suddenly realize, oh, I guess we have kafka now. I guess we&#x27;re a kafka shop and starts with a POC and then ends up you have all these tools. We call it the modern data stack. But yeah, I&#x27;m curious how your take on that in particular? Around start with the queue since you&#x27;ve just implemented it in postgres and probably had to use other tools in the past.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001516---adam"><em>[00:15:16]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001516---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001516---adam" title="Direct link to 001516---adam">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, a couple of places that I&#x27;ve worked at, it&#x27;s like, hey, we need to pass messages between two services. And any engineer will be like, all right, well, we&#x27;re going to evaluate what we have here. We want to try to do things like, oh, let&#x27;s keep things simple, not make things too complex. And then depending on the size of the organization, it&#x27;ll be like, well, we use Kafka for messaging, so use Kafka. And so it&#x27;s like, okay, so make progress. A lot of times it&#x27;s better to not fight that and just be like, we want to make progress, we just need our application to work. It&#x27;s not like Kafka wouldn&#x27;t work for this, but it&#x27;s definitely overkill for a lot of situations. So then it&#x27;s like, okay, we&#x27;re going to build this in Kafka and maybe the rest of the application is in postgres, but this message piece of it, we&#x27;re going to put it in Kafka. And from the application perspective, it&#x27;s kind of no difference. Like I said, it&#x27;s an overkill tool for a lot of use cases. But then when things start to go wrong and need to troubleshoot it, it&#x27;s like, okay, now we have to bring in the Kafka expert.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001635---adam"><em>[00:16:35]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001635---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001635---adam" title="Direct link to 001635---adam">â</a></h5><p>And if it&#x27;s a big company, it&#x27;s probably a handful of people who are on this Kafka team and they got a lot of other stuff going on. So it&#x27;s like, what do you have to do? You have to learn Kafka. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001647---ry"><em>[00:16:47]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001647---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001647---ry" title="Direct link to 001647---ry">â</a></h5><p>And you&#x27;re a small use case, right? You&#x27;re like a small unimportant use case. And so, yeah, you can&#x27;t get their attention. You kind of accepted the fact that, okay, I can learn. It&#x27;s kind of fun to learn new technologies and try new things out, right? That&#x27;s the day. Zero joy of learning something new. But then now all of a sudden you&#x27;ve got to support it, right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001709---adam"><em>[00:17:09]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001709---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001709---adam" title="Direct link to 001709---adam">â</a></h5><p>Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001710---ry"><em>[00:17:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001710---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001710---ry" title="Direct link to 001710---ry">â</a></h5><p>You support what you make a lot of. Yeah, you got judoed into that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001716---adam"><em>[00:17:16]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001716---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001716---adam" title="Direct link to 001716---adam">â</a></h5><p>In my career, it was fun to learn Kafka and there&#x27;s some things I really like about it, but then at the same time, it&#x27;s a very complex tool and it does take a team to run and manage it. Same with RabbitMQ. If you&#x27;re going to do those things, you need some people dedicated to making sure that they&#x27;re functioning the way you expect it to.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001745---ry"><em>[00:17:45]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001745---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001745---ry" title="Direct link to 001745---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, I think kind of leads into one of our core missions at the company, which you&#x27;re leading at Tembo, which is our stacks. I guess it probably would make sense for you to say a few words on what we&#x27;re trying to accomplish with stacks at the company.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001805---adam"><em>[00:18:05]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001805---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001805---adam" title="Direct link to 001805---adam">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. So stacks are workload optimized postgres clusters. So the message queue stack is one that we have and our goal with that is if you need to run a message queue, we want this to be the most optimized way to do a message queue on postgres. Of course, there&#x27;ll be a point in time when it&#x27;s like, hey, your use case has grown so big that maybe that stack&#x27;s not going to fit you, but that stack will be to the very edge of what postgres can do for that workload. We&#x27;re taking that same approach with our OLAP stack that we&#x27;re building right now. We have an OLTP stack, there&#x27;s a machine learning stack. So each one of these stacks is do it on postgres and we&#x27;re going to make it be the best possible squeeze every last piece of juice out of postgres that we possibly can for that workload.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001908---ry"><em>[00:19:08]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001908---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001908---ry" title="Direct link to 001908---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. And you&#x27;re curating extensions for each stack. What else are you doing besides that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001913---adam"><em>[00:19:13]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001913---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001913---adam" title="Direct link to 001913---adam">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, extensions are a big piece. A lot of that has to do with there are certain types of developer experience that we think people want around workloads. And then there&#x27;s the postgres configuration itself. So like, what should shared buffers be or how many parallel worker processes and how should the auto vacuum vacuum error be tuned for that workload? That&#x27;s a whole class of things that are unique to every stack. Of course, there&#x27;s like a user interface component of every stack as well. So if you want to come up and to look and see and observe the stack, there&#x27;ll be user interface metrics are kind of really tightly related to the UI, so there&#x27;s different metrics for every stack as well. Some of them are going to be the same across stacks. But for example, current number of messages in a queue, that&#x27;s like a metric that you can monitor, you can write alerts around that metric and it&#x27;s mostly unique to the message queue workload.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002032---ry"><em>[00:20:32]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002032---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002032---ry" title="Direct link to 002032---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. And if the message queue stack is competing against a commercial queue product, they probably have some sort of visualization of the state of each queue.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002045---adam"><em>[00:20:45]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#002045---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002045---adam" title="Direct link to 002045---adam">â</a></h5><p>Right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002046---ry"><em>[00:20:46]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002046---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002046---ry" title="Direct link to 002046---ry">â</a></h5><p>And so a postgres backed queue ought to have that same UI, that same monitoring tailored monitoring system. It makes it, I don&#x27;t know how many times harder versus just configuration and curating some extensions, but I think it&#x27;s all worth it to the user to be able to really defend their choice to use postgres for this use case against one of the modern data stack alternatives. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002120---adam"><em>[00:21:20]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#002120---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002120---adam" title="Direct link to 002120---adam">â</a></h5><p>Right? Yeah. I think something really useful that I like about having stacks and having postgres aligned to specific workloads, the complexity of an overall application can really come down a lot by running everything on postgres. You could still have separate postgres clusters for workloads, like a certain set of CPU and memory dedicated to mission critical process A and a separate one for this other mission critical process. But still when it comes to troubleshooting these things, you&#x27;re troubleshooting postgres and it&#x27;s not like, hey, I have to switch and be like, okay, now I&#x27;m troubleshooting Kafka, or jumping to Redis or jumping to Mongo or Snowflake. It&#x27;s still like the context switching I think, for the developers is big time minimized when it&#x27;s still the same underlying data store between all the different workloads, same technology. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002227---ry"><em>[00:22:27]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002227---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002227---ry" title="Direct link to 002227---ry">â</a></h5><p>And we have this vision of potentially having some built in stack connectivity, right, where these databases, if they&#x27;re all kind of sitting back to back to back so you have five different stacks they could and should be able to communicate really well with each other. And you should be able to write queries across them in the same way that Citus allows you to write queries across an array of postgres clusters very efficiently. You should be able to do the same thing here and pull data from multiple stacks with a very nice user experience, again, without having to move data around. So that&#x27;s one of the exciting things for me as a former airflow company founder. All these data pipelines are very painful between modern data stack companies. And one of the things I&#x27;m excited about is the possibility that we can give developers the option to not have to create all those pipelines.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002336---adam"><em>[00:23:36]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#002336---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002336---adam" title="Direct link to 002336---adam">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I&#x27;m really excited to work on that problem when we start doing that, but that&#x27;ll be I think, a really big differentiator is to say I have ten different machines running postgres and I have a single pane of view across all of them. I think it&#x27;s definitely doable. It&#x27;ll be challenging.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002402---ry"><em>[00:24:02]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002402---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002402---ry" title="Direct link to 002402---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, it&#x27;s a dream we&#x27;re chasing. Yeah. Good. Well, I think it was great chatting with you, Adam. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll have you on the show again. I know that, again, you&#x27;ve got a lot more extensions coming and appreciate the work you&#x27;ve done for the community so far and yeah, looking forward to seeing your future work and talking about it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002428---adam"><em>[00:24:28]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#002428---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002428---adam" title="Direct link to 002428---adam">â</a></h5><p>Sounds good.

Yeah, very nice to meet you. Yeah. So I&#x27;m Marco, I work at Microsoft and I&#x27;ve been working on Postgres extensions for about nine years now, starting with Citus, pgCron, and a bunch of other ones.

It&#x27;s more just us geeking out about Postgres, extensions, what they mean to users and opinions about anything and everything related to our work is fair game. Yeah, sounds good. So what&#x27;d you do before you got into Postgres stuff, out of curiosity?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000109---marco"><em>[00:01:09]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000109---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000109---marco" title="Direct link to 000109---marco">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. My background is more in distributed systems, so I spent a few years at AWS. It was quite early days in AWS when I think I joined. There were three Web Services. S3, SQS and EC2.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000124---ry"><em>[00:01:24]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000124---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000124---ry" title="Direct link to 000124---ry">â</a></h5><p>Wow.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000125---marco"><em>[00:01:25]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000125---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000125---marco" title="Direct link to 000125---marco">â</a></h5><p>And then we built number Four, which was CloudFront, which gives people started using S3 for websites, which it wasn&#x27;t really built for. But then we were asked to solve this and we built the CDN, and then we also built Route 53 for the DNS.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000140---ry"><em>[00:01:40]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000140---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000140---ry" title="Direct link to 000140---ry">â</a></h5><p>Wow.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000141---marco"><em>[00:01:41]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000141---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000141---marco" title="Direct link to 000141---marco">â</a></h5><p>And then yeah, I did a PhD in sort of self driving cars, but specifically like, cooperation between self driving cars, like, what if they can communicate with each other and sort of coordinate? So it&#x27;s sort of advanced distributed systems in a way as well. Yeah. So that led to me joining Citus, which is sort of founded by former Amazon folks.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000205---ry"><em>[00:02:05]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000205---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000205---ry" title="Direct link to 000205---ry">â</a></h5><p>Got it. So building Citus was probably easy compared to all other stuff, actually.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000212---marco"><em>[00:02:12]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000212---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000212---marco" title="Direct link to 000212---marco">â</a></h5><p>Yeah. If you do self driving cooperation between self driving cars, which is this kind of like life critical system distribute where your nodes kind of just move around and they move away from each other, it does make things relatively easy. But then yeah, building databases is never actually very easy.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000231---ry"><em>[00:02:31]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000231---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000231---ry" title="Direct link to 000231---ry">â</a></h5><p>No, I know.

I guess the challenge is always everything sort of in the word relational. Right. Like everything relates to everything else. There&#x27;s not like a feature you can implement without considering all the other aspects of the database and all the things that can happen concurrently with the operation that you&#x27;re working on and all the possible ways in which things can fail. Especially if you&#x27;re in a kind of distributed setup.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000301---ry"><em>[00:03:01]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000301---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000301---ry" title="Direct link to 000301---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think that&#x27;s really interesting perspective. You think of all of the configuration options, too. Adding a new configuration option adds complexity, adds flexibility, adds potential complex, and it&#x27;s tough.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000320---marco"><em>[00:03:20]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000320---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000320---marco" title="Direct link to 000320---marco">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, definitely. I think one thing we learned is there&#x27;s a sort of certain danger in creating modes where every setting you add, which can be on/off now you have two modes in your system. You add another setting that can be on/off. Now you have four modes in your system. It&#x27;s kind of this exponential explosion of possible ways in which your database might be running. And so that&#x27;s hard learned lesson that&#x27;s, like, don&#x27;t introduce major modes. Sometimes you have to because of backwards compatibility reasons, maybe, but you want to get rid of them over time.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000357---ry"><em>[00:03:57]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000357---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000357---ry" title="Direct link to 000357---ry">â</a></h5><p>Were you one of the first team members on Citus? Actually, I don&#x27;t really know the full history. Did it start as a fork and made its way as an extension, or was it always an extension?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000410---marco"><em>[00:04:10]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000410---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000410---marco" title="Direct link to 000410---marco">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I was one of the first, though I think Samay was already there. I think he&#x27;s joined Tembo. So but yeah, we started out as a fork and then we called it CitusDB, and then we made it an extension and called it Citus. Though I think the name CitusDB kind of stuck around for...I still hear it sometimes. But yeah, it was very pretty early days for extensions. Like 2015 PostGIS obviously existed. It was one of the first major ones. But yeah, we were lucky at the time. We had Andres Freund working for us. Well, he&#x27;s also now working for Microsoft, but he&#x27;s like one of the top Postgres committers, and we put him in a room for a while, know, can you turn this into an extension, please? And he came up with some terrible, terrible hacks. But over time, those also drove some of the extension APIs in Postgres itself, where things that used to require really terrible hacks are now kind of more structured and you can introduce your own sort of data structures into Postgres without doing lots of weird stuff.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000522---ry"><em>[00:05:22]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000522---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000522---ry" title="Direct link to 000522---ry">â</a></h5><p>Well, I was thinking probably not everybody knows what Citus is. Maybe if you could give a quick I&#x27;d love to hear a quick overview of what it is and then maybe a couple of things that maybe you can think of that are unusual, that people might not know about it, that are part of it. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a stupid question, but yeah, if you could try no.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000541---marco"><em>[00:05:41]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000541---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000541---marco" title="Direct link to 000541---marco">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, so it comes from basically this denotion that Postgres is ultimately limited to a single machine. I mean, you can read replicas, but you definitely cannot scale the writes. Usually if you have read replicas, they&#x27;ll kind of end up having the same stuff in memory. So you cannot really scale the memory either. And so Citus is a solution to basically adds sharding to Postgres in a very transparent way, where you can have tables that are sort of transparently sharded across many nodes, you still connect to a Postgres server. There&#x27;s just a table, looks, walks, and talks like a table. But if you insert into it, it actually gets rooted to a particular node. And if you insert another value, it might get rooted into another node that uses this hash distribution. And that way you can scale across infinitely many machines and have some users have petabytes of data in their Citus cluster part of the advantage is also that queries can get paralyzed on these tables because we can use all the nodes at the same time and multiple cores per node. But more and more it&#x27;s also actually being used for LTP workloads.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000655---marco"><em>[00:06:55]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000655---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000655---marco" title="Direct link to 000655---marco">â</a></h5><p>And particularly the most popular use case is actually multitenancy, where you have this kind of B2B app where you have lots of relatively independent users and you kind of want to just transparently spread those across different machines without having to actually manage that yourself and figure out how to move data around. Because that was all very kind of automated. You can just ask it to rebalance your data and it does that using logical replication. And so then you have the advantage of just as much memory as you need to make your application fast and as much disk IOPS as you need by just adding more machines with more disks and so that helps you scale. And then we have a sort of managed service in Azure around that. But yeah, we use every hook that&#x27;s available in Postgres to achieve things like starting with the planner hook. That&#x27;s one of the interesting things about Postgres. It&#x27;s like you just replace the whole planner with something else. You get a parsed query tree and then you can do whatever you want with it. You can just do some like okay, look at this query and log something interesting and then just go to the regular planner.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000812---marco"><em>[00:08:12]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000812---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000812---marco" title="Direct link to 000812---marco">â</a></h5><p>Or you could just do something completely different. And so we use all these hooks to kind of create this facade around Postgres tables where it&#x27;s like Postgres table is still there, you just cannot touch it. We just intercept everything that&#x27;s going on. The most recent and most terrible hack we did it was like the give it as this hack in Postgres so we can figure out so we have shards. Like the writes go into shards but then if you do logical decoding you see writes on shards, you don&#x27;t see writes on these what we call distributed tables. But the user doesn&#x27;t even know about shards probably. So how can we fix that? And there wasn&#x27;t really any kind of hook we could use to change the way that the logical decoding process works except that we realized that the client specifies a decoder name usually just hard coded like Pgoutput or Wal2json or test_decoding and that actually refers to the name of a .so,  like a shared library. And we realized we could create a .so with the same name and put it in a different directory and then change the dynamic library path to be prefixed with that directory so it would load our library instead.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000934---marco"><em>[00:09:34]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000934---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000934---marco" title="Direct link to 000934---marco">â</a></h5><p>This is kind of the worst thing we did. But it works nicely actually. I mean, that new .so file calls the original .so file and it kind of makes some changes to hide the sharding from the coding. But yeah, it is a hack. It&#x27;s very much a hack. But it&#x27;s nice that Postgres ultimately lets you do these kind of things.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="000959---ry"><em>[00:09:59]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000959---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000959---ry" title="Direct link to 000959---ry">â</a></h5><p>I think, like Citus says, there&#x27;s like a requirement that Citus loads first as an extension. Is that true? I&#x27;m trying to remember if I&#x27;m making that up.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001008---marco"><em>[00:10:08]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001008---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001008---marco" title="Direct link to 001008---marco">â</a></h5><p>It is true. I mean, maybe it&#x27;s a bit of laziness on our part, but it&#x27;s also.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001013---ry"><em>[00:10:13]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001013---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001013---ry" title="Direct link to 001013---ry">â</a></h5><p>Because...</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001016---marco"><em>[00:10:16]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001016---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001016---marco" title="Direct link to 001016---marco">â</a></h5><p>We generate very weird plans that wouldn&#x27;t make any sense to other extensions. So if you have multiple layers of planner hooks, you kind of want Citus to be but by putting it first, it actually becomes the last because everyone else overwrites Citus. And then hopefully when you go through the chain of planner hook, Citus is the last one remaining and it can produce some quirky distributed query plan that doesn&#x27;t make sense to anyone else and pick that up.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001048---ry"><em>[00:10:48]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001048---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001048---ry" title="Direct link to 001048---ry">â</a></h5><p>Are there known extensions that aren&#x27;t compatible with Citus that you&#x27;re aware of or as far as you know? It kind of works with most everything.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001056---marco"><em>[00:10:56]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001056---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001056---marco" title="Direct link to 001056---marco">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I mean, Citus is a little bit of a paradigm shift because now you have many servers and some extensions just don&#x27;t make sense if you&#x27;re on many servers because they keep their state on one of them and then they&#x27;re not aware of others. But most things just work. But I kind of feel like there&#x27;s this notion of a deep extension, if you will, like timescaleDB or Citus. They kind of go really deep into planner hooks and change behavioral characteristics. Whereas something like PostGIS and a lot of extensions that just introduce new types and functions. They&#x27;re sitting on top of this much more clean interface and usually the interoperability of those things is pretty good. But Timescale has this notion of a hyper table inside as a distributed table and you cannot really make a distributed hyper table. But yeah, compatibility, it comes down to sometimes also the individual features. It&#x27;s not like if you install one, then the other doesn&#x27;t work anymore. I mean, that happens for some extensions, but for Citus, most other things just kind of work with it. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001208---ry"><em>[00:12:08]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001208---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001208---ry" title="Direct link to 001208---ry">â</a></h5><p>So let&#x27;s talk about pg_Cron. How early were you involved in that project?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001213---marco"><em>[00:12:13]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001213---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001213---marco" title="Direct link to 001213---marco">â</a></h5><p>Well, I created it. I used to have this thing where I am much more productive on flights and I flew to San Francisco a lot for a while and then I had a few of these projects that I was just working on on flights and pg_Cron was one of them. And so at the time we had customers who did kind of this real time analytics scenarios on Postgres on Citus. And those involve a lot of materialization. So a bunch of raw data keeps coming in like time series data. And at some point you want to take all the new data and kind of pre aggregate it inside of the database and that needs to happen periodically. I think the background worker concept was pretty new at the time. I don&#x27;t know. This was many years ago. And so I realized you could do something like Cron. It maybe also comes from the Amazon background because Amazon, at least at the time, was all like glued together with Cron, Perl and R Sync. There were Cron jobs that would R sync metadata files to other servers and it was all pretty hacky. But anyway, I figured it would be pretty useful to have this kind of thing in Postgres also for just vacuuming or calling certain stored procedures that, I don&#x27;t know, delete your old data.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001342---marco"><em>[00:13:42]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001342---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001342---marco" title="Direct link to 001342---marco">â</a></h5><p>Like those kind of maintenance tasks. It was just much easier if that&#x27;s like you run a command once and then it works forever, rather than I need to maintain this separate infrastructure that periodically connects to the database and does that. So that became quite popular. I think pretty much all major managed services have pg_Cron now. Yeah, I kind of built it as a very I mean, it was definitely my side project. So I also built it as a very low maintenance thing that I wouldn&#x27;t have to constantly fix bugs in. Also a little bit selective about adding new features. For a long time I resisted adding people want like, can I run a job every few seconds? And normally Cron is like at the minute, granularity. But recently I caved and I added doing it every few seconds because I realized it&#x27;s kind of feature if there&#x27;s some kind of issue, some kind of memory leak or whatever, if you run it every few seconds, it&#x27;s going to be way worse than if you run it once a minute. So you need to be more careful in that case. But you can now also do like every second, for example, which is kind of useful.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001456---ry"><em>[00:14:56]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001456---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001456---ry" title="Direct link to 001456---ry">â</a></h5><p>That&#x27;s awesome. Yeah, I was looking at we&#x27;re just building a new data warehouse, trying to use Postgres to do that. I&#x27;m exploring all the columnar extension as well, which sort of is part of Citus. I don&#x27;t know if you did any work on that, but yeah, looking at pg_cron versus pg_timetable, have you had the question of what about have you looked at timetable and its features and yeah, I&#x27;m kind of curious to get your assessment of the two.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001528---marco"><em>[00:15:28]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001528---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001528---marco" title="Direct link to 001528---marco">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I&#x27;ve looked at it a mean for a long time. It wasn&#x27;t so much an extension. I think nowadays it is more or less an autonomous extension, I think. Yeah, I mean, it&#x27;s somewhat more complex in a way. I don&#x27;t feel like competitive of like you should use pg_cron or use pg_timetable. I think pg_cron is just intentionally simple such just this very simple thing that just works and does what you&#x27;d expect it to mean almost unless your time zone is in a different unless you&#x27;re not in GMT, then it sort of doesn&#x27;t quite do what you&#x27;d expect it to anyway. So yeah, I think Cron is just simpler. But if you need some more specific, I guess it comes down to do you need the extra features that pg_timetable adds? But I think for most people, pg_cron is good enough because you can also just I&#x27;ve also seen people do their own kind of job queues on top of pg_cron, where you just have this thing that runs. Every few seconds or every minute, and then looks are there some jobs to do? And it actually executes the stuff that&#x27;s in the job state.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001639---marco"><em>[00:16:39]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001639---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001639---marco" title="Direct link to 001639---marco">â</a></h5><p>So it&#x27;s kind of composable as well. You can build your own things on top if you want. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001645---ry"><em>[00:16:45]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001645---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001645---ry" title="Direct link to 001645---ry">â</a></h5><p>And especially if you could trigger it every second to check for work. Yeah, that&#x27;s just fine. Yeah, I&#x27;m coming from my previous company was doing Apache Airflow and so it&#x27;s like kind of getting back to some of the stuff. I mean, obviously that&#x27;s a very complicated system with a lot of capabilities and dag like chaining of tasks and fanning out and all that kind of stuff. But yeah, I think it&#x27;s interesting to try to do some of that stuff inside of Postgres without requiring we&#x27;re trying to go with the mantra of like just use Postgres for everything.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001729---marco"><em>[00:17:29]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001729---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001729---marco" title="Direct link to 001729---marco">â</a></h5><p>It&#x27;s not a bad mantra. You&#x27;ve got, I guess, different levels of commitment to that idea of how much of our backend can we shove into Postgres? And there&#x27;s these GraphQL extensions where you pretty much put your entire backend in Postgres. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001751---ry"><em>[00:17:51]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001751---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001751---ry" title="Direct link to 001751---ry">â</a></h5><p>Your API, is there?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001752---marco"><em>[00:17:52]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001752---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001752---marco" title="Direct link to 001752---marco">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I guess Supabase is going pretty long way in that direction, but at some point you want to debug stuff or you want to have certain rollout procedures. And sometimes Postgres is not as mature a tool as just shipping Python files somewhere. There&#x27;s just better CI tools for most normal programming languages than for Postgres. So you have to find the right balance, I think.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001824---ry"><em>[00:18:24]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001824---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001824---ry" title="Direct link to 001824---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, we&#x27;re building and maybe this shouldn&#x27;t have happened, but apparently yesterday we were working on a new FDW and I think it hit an exception that wasn&#x27;t handled and it appeared to shut down the Postgres server. This is kind of fun. Should that have happened? Should that be possible? Should an extension error take it down? But we&#x27;re still investigating that. But yeah, I think there&#x27;s always risk with trying to do a lot inside, but I think with a mature extension that&#x27;s well tested and battle tested, it should be. I mean, if you think about everything that&#x27;s happening, there&#x27;s no SRP in Postgres, right? It&#x27;s not just doing one thing, it&#x27;s got a vacuum. There&#x27;s like lots of processes running and so then the question is, is it a sin to add one more thing? Especially if it has the capability to have a background worker? It&#x27;s just like staring you in the face. Like use me.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="001929---marco"><em>[00:19:29]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001929---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001929---marco" title="Direct link to 001929---marco">â</a></h5><p>Like the extension APIs are slowly evolving from just a complete hacky approach for people to try out their Postgres batches before merging them into core. To some, I guess Extensibility was there from the start. But that&#x27;s more too for custom types and custom functions than it is for planner hooks and background workers and those kind of things. Those are a little bit more what if we add this function pointer to see maybe extensions can do something interesting with it. And it&#x27;s not very extremely well structured, but I mean the whole rust like pgrx and building extensions in rust, it does create an opportunity to have a little bit more of a well defined method of developing extensions.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002025---ry"><em>[00:20:25]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002025---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002025---ry" title="Direct link to 002025---ry">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think what&#x27;s interesting to me about Postgres is like the history of forks and it sucks to be on the true fork, as I&#x27;m sure you were aware. Creating the extension framework helps people out of the land of forks, but it does create the possibility for even more risk extensions in terms of all that. So it&#x27;s like a double edged sword. I think it&#x27;s great though, that to me is the reason why Postgres is doing so well now, is all that freedom that the core team has given the community in terms of how to use it. It&#x27;s unprecedented, almost dangerous, but I also think empowering to developers who want to have some fun with their database.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002121---marco"><em>[00:21:21]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002121---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002121---marco" title="Direct link to 002121---marco">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, definitely. What we also often find is just an extension versus an external tool. At least we&#x27;re sort of in the business of running a Postgres managed service. But even if you have just your own Postgres servers, it has a fairly straightforward deployment model, right? Like you don&#x27;t have to create a whole separate cluster with its own configuration that connects to your Postgres database and does things with it. You just shove it into your existing Postgres server and it&#x27;ll restart the background workers and you don&#x27;t have to worry about all those things. It does have a lot of merit, actually, to develop a software as a Postgres extension. I mean, it comes with its own protocol. I think the most interesting thing is just like you get all this synergy between all these different extensions, that the sum of the parts is greater than the or what is it? The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. But also things like PostGIS and Citus, they kind of layer like you can distribute it, geospatial joins, whatever. But then also maybe you have some interesting function and you can run it periodically using pg_cron.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002239---marco"><em>[00:22:39]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002239---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002239---marco" title="Direct link to 002239---marco">â</a></h5><p>And it&#x27;s like all these things kind of give you this little platform where you can just by running SQL queries, do increasingly interesting things. Maybe you have an FTW that does an Http call and you run it using pg_cron, for example. And now your Postgres server is not just pg_cron, is not just Postgres cron, it&#x27;s actually anything cron. Like you can reach out to other systems. So that plugability.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002310---ry"><em>[00:23:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002310---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002310---ry" title="Direct link to 002310---ry">â</a></h5><p>I literally have a co-op that started last week and his first task was, I said create an FDW for this API and use pg_cron and ingest that data. And he&#x27;s like, well, how do I do it? Just brand new to data warehousing in general, but he&#x27;s got the FDW built and now he&#x27;s working on if he has any problems, I&#x27;ll send him your way. Kidding. I won&#x27;t. Kidding, kidding. I won&#x27;t do that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002341---marco"><em>[00:23:41]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002341---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002341---marco" title="Direct link to 002341---marco">â</a></h5><p>If there&#x27;s bugs open issues like I&#x27;d like to know, of course.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002344---ry"><em>[00:23:44]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002344---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002344---ry" title="Direct link to 002344---ry">â</a></h5><p>But there&#x27;s no bugs. No. So do you have any long flights coming up where you have some new extensions coming?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002351---marco"><em>[00:23:51]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002351---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002351---marco" title="Direct link to 002351---marco">â</a></h5><p>No, we had a baby last year. It&#x27;s like my flight budget is very low at the moment. That&#x27;s true.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002358---ry"><em>[00:23:58]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002358---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002358---ry" title="Direct link to 002358---ry">â</a></h5><p>Your latest extension is human.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002401---marco"><em>[00:24:01]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002401---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002401---marco" title="Direct link to 002401---marco">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, but yeah, I&#x27;d like to play more with Rust because that the problem with extensions in the past. Like developing them in C has always been like c doesn&#x27;t have any good sort of dependency framework. There&#x27;s these old established library like, I don&#x27;t know, LibZ and LibXML or something, like something that was developed 20 years ago and now, okay, every system has it, you can use it, but for anything newer than ten years, it&#x27;s extremely annoying and hard to use a C library. And then even if you can figure out your configure and your make files, the memory allocation is probably going to not play nicely with Postgres. So that&#x27;s where Rust is kind of interesting. Now there&#x27;s this whole ecosystem of open source libraries that can potentially become extensions and we&#x27;re still sort of at the very start of that, what&#x27;s going to happen?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002505---ry"><em>[00:25:05]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002505---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002505---ry" title="Direct link to 002505---ry">â</a></h5><p>It&#x27;s kind of scary because it could be very much of a Cambrian explosion. What happens if there are 300 new extensions that are worth adding? It&#x27;s sort of a pain for the managed service providers.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002519---marco"><em>[00:25:19]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002519---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002519---marco" title="Direct link to 002519---marco">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, definitely. Yeah. And they can have funny incompatibilities. It helps that then Rust is a little bit more safe and a little bit more not managed, but the memory allocation is a bit more sort of safe as well. But then, yeah, you can have a lot of weird bugs if you combine all these unknown bits of code.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002546---ry"><em>[00:25:46]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002546---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002546---ry" title="Direct link to 002546---ry">â</a></h5><p>That&#x27;s great. Are there any extensions that you&#x27;ve run across either recently or in the past that you love, that you would mention as exciting? I mean, you mentioned PostGIS and anything else that you can think of. It&#x27;s no big deal if not.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002604---marco"><em>[00:26:04]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002604---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002604---marco" title="Direct link to 002604---marco">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, there&#x27;s many. I&#x27;m sort of intrigued by Postgres_ML. It&#x27;s like this just machine learning extension that they seem to be doing a lot of interesting things. I don&#x27;t have a good use case for it myself yet, but I really like what you&#x27;re doing. Also in Rust, I think MIT licensed, so it can be used in a lot of places. There&#x27;s of course a lot of buzz around pg_vector and more recently pg_embedding, which is sort of an interesting kind of development because now I think they both added this HNSW indexes which are faster than the IFV flat indexes that pgvector provided. But then it also means they are now incompatible with the latest versions. You can create one or the other, not both, which is a little awkward. But I think that is where, of course, one of the most fastest moving areas and I think some of these things will be figured out.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002706---ry"><em>[00:27:06]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002706---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002706---ry" title="Direct link to 002706---ry">â</a></h5><p>Have you gotten those extensions added to the Citus managed service?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002711---marco"><em>[00:27:11]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002711---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002711---marco" title="Direct link to 002711---marco">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, we definitely have pg_vector. Yeah, I mean, I think that took the landscape by storm. I think they&#x27;re pretty much on every managed service now.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002719---ry"><em>[00:27:19]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002719---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002719---ry" title="Direct link to 002719---ry">â</a></h5><p>It&#x27;s interesting, we&#x27;re working on this thing called Trunk where we&#x27;re trying to maybe I don&#x27;t know if we can get you guys to participate, but the idea would be to send some metadata to some sort of central repository that we&#x27;d know, like which extensions are trending, waning, completely dead or not. I just think it&#x27;s interesting as a new person coming into the Postgres ecosystem, there&#x27;s just this library of potential extensions that it&#x27;s pretty expansive and kind of trails off in a know because you can find them loosely here or there on GitHub. But I think having a better directory of them would be good for the community.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002804---marco"><em>[00:28:04]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002804---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002804---marco" title="Direct link to 002804---marco">â</a></h5><p>Yeah, I guess. One thing that&#x27;s also tricky about extensions, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;d want it in an ideal world, you write it once and then it works forever. In the real world, every Postgres version potentially breaks your extension, so someone has to actually go and fix it. For new Postgres versions, sometimes it&#x27;s okay. I think with pg_cron, I had like once or twice. It&#x27;s like I think Postgres 16 didn&#x27;t actually no, it did require some fixes. I think there was one Postgres version which didn&#x27;t require any fixes. Maybe PG 15, I was already happy. But usually C is a bit of this wild west of programming languages. But yeah, sometimes just some function header changes, there&#x27;s an extra argument and then none of the extensions that use that function compile you have to have some level of maintenance behind each extension. Well, not every extension does well. Great.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002903---ry"><em>[00:29:03]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002903---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002903---ry" title="Direct link to 002903---ry">â</a></h5><p>I mean, it was great to chat with you. Happy to have you back on again. If you have a big new release of Citus, I don&#x27;t know, do you guys have any big plans for it or has it reached a certain point of stability where it is what it is? Yeah, I&#x27;m kind of curious.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002919---marco"><em>[00:29:19]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002919---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002919---marco" title="Direct link to 002919---marco">â</a></h5><p>Well, our most recent major release added this kind of notion of Schema based Sharding, where so far it&#x27;s always been like you have distributed tables and you have a distribution column and you need to pick which columns you use. But the Schema based Sharding is just like every Schema becomes its own group, own Shard, essentially, so it might be on a different node. So for apps that use Schema per tenant, that&#x27;s a very nice model. And so we&#x27;re investing more in that at the moment.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="002949---ry"><em>[00:29:49]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002949---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002949---ry" title="Direct link to 002949---ry">â</a></h5><p>Well, great.
