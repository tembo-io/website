Though I think the name CitusDB kind of stuck around for...I still hear it sometimes. But yeah, it was very pretty early days for extensions. Like 2015 PostGIS obviously existed. It was one of the first major ones. But yeah, we were lucky at the time. We had Andres Freund working for us. Well, he's also now working for Microsoft, but he's like one of the top Postgres committers, and we put him in a room for a while, know, can you turn this into an extension, please? And he came up with some terrible, terrible hacks.

I mean, you can read replicas, but you definitely cannot scale the writes. Usually if you have read replicas, they'll kind of end up having the same stuff in memory. So you cannot really scale the memory either. And so Citus is a solution to basically adds sharding to Postgres in a very transparent way, where you can have tables that are sort of transparently sharded across many nodes, you still connect to a Postgres server. There's just a table, looks, walks, and talks like a table. But if you insert into it, it actually gets rooted to a particular node. And if you insert another value, it might get rooted into another node that uses this hash distribution. And that way you can scale across infinitely many machines and have some users have petabytes of data in their Citus cluster part of the advantage is also that queries can get paralyzed on these tables because we can use all the nodes at the same time and multiple cores per node. But more and more it's also actually being used for LTP workloads."),(0,n.kt)("h5",{id:"000655---marco"},(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"h5"},"[00:06:55]"," - Marco")),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"And particularly the most popular use case is actually multitenancy, where you have this kind of B2B app where you have lots of relatively independent users and you kind of want to just transparently spread those across different machines without having to actually manage that yourself and figure out how to move data around. Because that was all very kind of automated. You can just ask it to rebalance your data and it does that using logical replication. And so then you have the advantage of just as much memory as you need to make your application fast and as much disk IOPS as you need by just adding more machines with more disks and so that helps you scale. And then we have a sort of managed service in Azure around that. But yeah, we use every hook that's available in Postgres to achieve things like starting with the planner hook. That's one of the interesting things about Postgres. It's like you just replace the whole planner with something else. You get a parsed query tree and then you can do whatever you want with it.

And so we use all these hooks to kind of create this facade around Postgres tables where it's like Postgres table is still there, you just cannot touch it. We just intercept everything that's going on. The most recent and most terrible hack we did it was like the give it as this hack in Postgres so we can figure out so we have shards. Like the writes go into shards but then if you do logical decoding you see writes on shards, you don't see writes on these what we call distributed tables. But the user doesn't even know about shards probably. So how can we fix that? And there wasn't really any kind of hook we could use to change the way that the logical decoding process works except that we realized that the client specifies a decoder name usually just hard coded like Pgoutput or Wal2json or test_decoding and that actually refers to the name of a .so,  like a shared library.

They kind of go really deep into planner hooks and change behavioral characteristics. Whereas something like PostGIS and a lot of extensions that just introduce new types and functions. They're sitting on top of this much more clean interface and usually the interoperability of those things is pretty good. But Timescale has this notion of a hyper table inside as a distributed table and you cannot really make a distributed hyper table.

And so at the time we had customers who did kind of this real time analytics scenarios on Postgres on Citus. And those involve a lot of materialization. So a bunch of raw data keeps coming in like time series data. And at some point you want to take all the new data and kind of pre aggregate it inside of the database and that needs to happen periodically. I think the background worker concept was pretty new at the time. I don't know. This was many years ago. And so I realized you could do something like Cron. It maybe also comes from the Amazon background because Amazon, at least at the time, was all like glued together with Cron, Perl and R Sync. There were Cron jobs that would R sync metadata files to other servers and it was all pretty hacky.

So I also built it as a very low maintenance thing that I wouldn't have to constantly fix bugs in. Also a little bit selective about adding new features. For a long time I resisted adding people want like, can I run a job every few seconds? And normally Cron is like at the minute, granularity. But recently I caved and I added doing it every few seconds because I realized it's kind of feature if there's some kind of issue, some kind of memory leak or whatever, if you run it every few seconds, it's going to be way worse than if you run it once a minute.

So yeah, I think Cron is just simpler. But if you need some more specific, I guess it comes down to do you need the extra features that pg_timetable adds?
