So a lot of what PostgresML does is just give you functions that go off and make rest calls or download data from elsewhere in the Internet and put it in your database for you, give you access to some pre trained machine learning models.

It's more like the sales reps at those companies decided that this company is going to be a salesforce company or a snowflake company. Right.

A lot of times it's better to not fight that and just be like, we want to make progress, we just need our application to work. It's not like Kafka wouldn't work for this, but it's definitely overkill for a lot of situations.

We're taking that same approach with our OLAP stack that we're building right now. We have an OLTP stack, there's a machine learning stack.

That's a whole class of things that are unique to every stack. Of course, there's like a user interface component of every stack as well. So if you want to come up and to look and see and observe the stack, there'll be user interface metrics are kind of really tightly related to the UI, so there's different metrics for every stack as well.
