There's the Foreign Data Wrapper API, which Supabase released a project that they call Wrappers that'll let you create foreign data wrappers using Rust backed up by Pgrx. So kind of the next big API around that genre of internals. There would be the Table Access Method APIs, and we haven't exposed these at all yet. They're actually difficult to get at even through our bindings just because of the way they're set up in the postgres sources.

Typically the usage pattern is you create the index indexing all of the columns in the table and you point it to an Elasticsearch endpoint over Http or Https, and the ZomboDB keeps that index up to date.

There's a full set of SQL builder functions, so you can build query DSL through SQL statements. You can mix and match these things together. It's pretty sophisticated on that front, and it also exposes nearly all of Elasticsearch's aggregate endpoints to enable you to do really interesting aggregations with your full text. And since all the fields of a table are also stored in the Elasticsearch index, you can do some really interesting things that involve full text queries and aggregating on various metadata fields and do all this with a large distributed elastic search cluster behind the scenes and do it in near real time. It's really slick. The downside to ZomboDB is that you now have an Elastic search cluster running alongside your postgres cluster. And ES is a living breathing system. It requires significant attention and maintenance in production. It gives you a lot of capabilities to scale out horizontally very easily, but it is its own living breathing system there."),(0,i.kt)("h5",{id:"001042---ry"},(0,i.kt)("em",{parentName:"h5"},"[00:10:42]"," - Ry")),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Yeah, it'd be great if you can build a version of this without requiring elastic."),(0,i.kt)("h5",{id:"001046---eric"},(0,i.kt)("em",{parentName:"h5"},"[00:10:46]"," - Eric")),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Yeah, I know a guy that's working on that.

The plaintiffs will provide the defendants with a list of keywords that need to be searched in order to find documents that are responsive to particular to these topics.
