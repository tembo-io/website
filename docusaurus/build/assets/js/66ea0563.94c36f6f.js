And when we were working with this German automaker, they just really needed high quality full text search within Postgres. So the promo we were building for them, and instead we had to glue Elasticsearch or some vector database on top. And it was just a nightmare.

Basically go one level deeper than your current idea is similar to what we did at Astronomer, because we were basically building a competitor to segment clickstream data processing. And then we started using Airflow. Then we said, hey, let's just provide airflow as a service. And kind of made that switch to go down a level and that was the winning pivot for that company.

At first we didn't know pgrx was a thing, and we were like, oh my God, how on earth is this even going to be a thing? And then we found out pgrx was a thing and we're like, wow, it went from near impossible to quite doable, really.

It wasn't done before. And so sort of our initial interest, I would say, has come from that. So typically when people wanted to do this, they would have some managed Postgres provider, of which there are many, and then they would use Elastic and then they would need to combine the two and then run the two and so on. It can be a ton of work. And so ParadeDB sort of makes that a single system and especially for small companies, which is where you've been really, it's been a lot easier to manage, I would say.

And there's one way to find it via similarity, but there's also sometimes you just want to start from a clean place. And so I think both are quite valuable. Most of the people we talk to, hybrid search is very important to them, like the combination of the two, both big and small companies. And that's one of the reasons why we built Parade the way we did today, where pgvector exists and so many others. And I would almost say vector search is kind of table stake now. We don't really have to innovate on that so much ourselves, I would say. But the traditional search is kind of the piece that's been missing, which is why we released this first extension, pg_bm25, and then we offered the combination of both as well ","[inaudible 11:29]","  with another extension called pg_search, which we're going to be publicizing more heavily soon."),(0,i.kt)("h5",{id:"001135---ry"},"[00:11:35]"," - Ry"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Yeah, I think it seems like, well, it seems to me like everything has to have an AI story or else perhaps it's been outdated.

And that's kind of how we think about it. There are so many people that are trying to bring AI when there was nothing useful to begin with. Well, I really think of AI as taking something that was useful to begin with and making it that much better. And so it kind of plays quite well actually with the way we've been going about delivering this product and saying like, hey, we'll just give you really good full text search and obviously so much more can be done.

Now our big milestone is we're about to release our own small version of managed Postgres ish specifically for ParadeDB to test how else we can deliver value to people. Like many that have been using the product so far have been using our self hosted version, which I'm sure you're extremely familiar with how people don't want to do this, doing Tembo. So that's the next big milestone that's coming, trying to learn to manage this. And then after that we have a couple of, I think after that we'll see the exact number.

This is another thing I've been thinking about around just even like we have stacks at Tembo with different use cases for Postgres, and then some things ought to be workloads separated from other things. Like for example, do you keep your analytical workload separate from transactional? That's clear. But search is interesting, whether that's like an add on. Is that just work that the transactional database should be doing, or is it somehow, do you think the workload for search should be isolated from traditional transactional workloads? From an application standpoint, that's a good question."),(0,i.kt)("h5",{id:"001536---phil"},"[00:15:36]"," - Phil"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"I think it depends what product you're building, to be honest, because you don't want to slow down transactions. That's something that's very important to us. For example, I think it's possible to integrate it, actually. I think it's up to you, the way we're thinking about it. So the way we've built ParadeDB is we offer weak consistency over search. So what this means is the way we build searches, we have inverted indices that store the tokenized data that you want to search over, but those are weakly consistent. So just like if you use Elastic, for example, and something like Zombodb, and then you synchronize it, there will be some lag between transactions being updated in your database and eventually being reflected in your search engine, the same thing happens, but it happens automatically for ParadB, instead of being it can be minutes sometimes here will be like a few seconds at the very most, but it ensures that your transactions are never slowed down, which is quite critical for people. So I think if you build in that way, it's actually quite possible to centralize it and have it be integrated with the actual database. If you don't use a product where search is built that way, then I don't think you want to slow down your transaction so you have to isolate them."),(0,i.kt)("h5",{id:"001648---ry"},"[00:16:48]"," - Ry"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Yeah, I think a lot of people just obviously just do it inside their transactional database because it seems like overkill. Spin up a new Postgres, just especially like traditional shitty full tech search that's available. But if we want to get good search, if I wanted to build really good search into an application, I would go buy Algolia or something like that. And that clearly is a microservice at that point, right? I'm sending data to them to index and they're sending me back results really quickly that are happening. It's not taxing my main database as a part of that. So I kind of like thinking of search as, let's call it great search as a microservice candidate for sure, because the better you make it, the more compute it requires. The more compute it requires, the more it's competing. Right? So I don't know, I like the idea of just taking that worldview.

So we came out of college, we were so incredibly into it and we wanted to be perfect. We cared so tremendously about what we did, that we always went above and beyond and it always made the product better and it involved writing more code, but it did not always make the product better in a way that meaningfully improved the experience of the user or brought us closer to product market fit. Right. And so I think if you think of a work of art like it's never finished, it needs to be perfect, versus a science experiment is more like, what's the bare minimum I can do to validate or invalidate this hypothesis I have or deliver value to a customer.

Like when we started astronomer, I have a good friend, Greg Neiheisel. He was CTO and basically my partner of crime. And we just very much mind melded on a lot of things. But our attitude following your principle was really what we were building was this beautiful lattice of glue, and everything was open source inside. So we used, for example, we used Google's material design, which had just come out, and we built a UI, like, adhering to it perfectly, and ended up being a beautiful UI because guess what? Those guys built a great framework and we had no designer on the team. Google was our designer. We would joke about it all the time, and we actually chose a color scheme for the company that was kind of Googley, had the same four main colors. So it was really easy to build something great. But that we really built the first version of our product was entirely open source components just glued together in a unique way. And that was our art. It was like this inner skeleton of orchestration, or just like I said, I can think of it like a lattice of glue that's holding all these things together. And, yeah, it was a very successful product. And it looks basically how you arrange open source components is art. It's a creative endeavor, I think, and it's enough for a brand new product. It's enough art. You don't have to go and reinvent, like, for example, the airflow UI during this really hard early project. And you don't have to go reinvent the Postgres UI.

When we were building our first company, our first product, we felt very righteous. We were doing something very difficult and objectively, technically difficult. And a lot of people have tried before, and we were like, they must have done it wrong. Who are they? People with more experience and context than us to know how to do this really well. And so we always started every premise of what we were doing from the premise that we were correct. Right. And then we were strived to further validate the fact that we were correct.
