Everybody we're talking about MySQL like the only database with open source and yeah, at that time I saw the PostgresQL, I tried to install it and run it. It was hard for me to do that because at that time the version was like 7.4 something and at that time there was no installer for Windows and we were mostly like Windows guys at that times. So, yeah, I need to install Linux and then install Postgres. Yeah, I managed to do that, but I wasn't happy about it. The whole process is like I feel like cumbersome or something like that.

And having a queue managed inside the Postgres, you're kind of like straddling, right? Because you have a container next to it.

Should you serve that Rust API as a separate container and have the separation of concerns?
