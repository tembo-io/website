# Tembo Stacks Roadmap

Tembo is working hard to build a useful set of "Tembo Stacks" for a number of Postgres use cases.

Initial Stacks include:

- Standard - Postgres with infrastructure and configuration tuned for general purpose computing and storage needs
- OLTP - Online Transaction Processing — for transactional data use case
- Enterprise LLM - build, train, deploy machine learning models and build a vector database for LLM and search use cases
- Message Queue — build applications like job or task queues, event-driven architectures, and more

Stacks in development:

- OLAP / Data warehouse (Snowflake)
- Time series data (Timescale)
- Full-text search (Elastic)
- Real-time analytics (Couchbase)
- GraphQL layer (Hasura)
