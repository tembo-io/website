# Introduction

Say goodbye to database sprawl, and hello to Postgres. 

Tembo is the Postgres developer platform for building every data service. We collapse the database sprawl and empower users with a high-performance, fully-extensible managed Postgres service. With Tembo, developers can quickly create specialized data services using Stacks, pre-built Postgres configurations, and deploy without complex builds or additional data teams.

## Ready to Get Started?

It's Postgres the way it *should* be. You don't have to be a database expert in order to have an expert-level managed database at your disposal. Get started with our managed Postgres service, 
[Tembo Cloud](https://cloud.tembo.io).

## What Are Stacks?

Stacks are pre-built Postgres configurations optimized for common enterprise needs. They are a simple, seamless way to create and deploy specialized data services. [Learn more â†’](/docs/category/tembo-stacks).
