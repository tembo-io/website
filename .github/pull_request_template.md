# Notes for blog or docs authors:

-   The `image: ` field in frontmatter of blogs should always be a `png` (`svg` will not work for social previews)
-   You must also duplicate the asset used in `image :` inside of the [public folder](https://github.com/tembo-io/website/tree/main/public)
-   Please write a `description: ` in the frontmatter of any new blog or doc
-   Read more [here](https://github.com/tembo-io/website?tab=readme-ov-file#writing-a-blog-post-%EF%B8%8F)
