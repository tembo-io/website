                <p class='font-secondary font-normal text-base text-otherGrey'>
                    Enterprises can find themselves spending many millions per year on a growing 
                    sprawl of data vendors. Our aim is to help you fight back against this.
                </p>

                <p class='font-secondary font-normal text-base text-otherGrey'>
                    <b>Postgres</b> (and its assimilation of 25+ years of database innovation) 
                    is the perfect tool to battle this; It is open-source, extensible, flexible, 
                    and available from many vendors (therefore, somewhat lock-in resistant). 
                </p>

                <p class='font-secondary font-normal text-base text-otherGrey'>
                    However, most managed Postgres vendors provide a stripped-down version of 
                    Postgres that restricts developer creativity. Or a few specialized vendors 
                    provide a managed offering around a specific use case, but not a full 
                    spectrum of use cases.
                </p>

                <p class='font-secondary font-normal text-base text-otherGrey'>
                    Tembo is “multi-workload” Postgres and aims to integrate the <b>entire</b> 
                    Postgres OSS ecosystem, providing developers confidence to use Postgres however 
                    they like. It also packages and tunes Postgres for common use cases, as an 
                    open-source library of

                >Some ways we can help...</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>If you have a team <b>self-hosting Postgres</b> (perhaps against their desire) because they are doing something that managed Postgres providers don't support, we can rectify this.</li>
                    <li>If you have a team <b>managing a large number of Postgres clusters</b>, but feel that they are wasting money because the clusters are over-provisioned (not adapting to workloads), we are building a game-changing solution for Postgres fleet management they should have a look at.</li>
                    <li>If you'd like to <b>consolidate a wide range of database workloads</b> to Postgres, and accomplish that through a single vendor, we should talk.</li>
                    <li>If you'd like to <b>productionize LLMs/RAGs</b> at the lowest possible cost, we can show you how Postgres may be your best bet.</li>
                    <li>If you need the <b>flexibility and security of self-hosted Postgres</b>, but would prefer a polished developer SaaS experience, we offer a hybrid solution that provides the best of both worlds.</li>
                    <li>If you want to <b>use Postgres for more</b> — for time series, for data warehousing, for vector search, with bottomless storage, for message queue, as an API (what?) — let's talk.</li>
                    <li>If you need a <b>simple transition path to the cloud</b> for your data workloads, we offer a very flexible and powerful solution.</li>
                    <li>If you need to <b>lock down standards</b> on how your developers use Postgres, for security or any other reasons, we have a solution for this (custom Tembo Stacks)</li>
