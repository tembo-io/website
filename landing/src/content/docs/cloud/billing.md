title: Tembo Cloud Billing
---

You only use what you need, so you should only pay for what you need.

Our usage-based model is designed to scale with your growth, offering both hobby (free) and production (paid) instances.

## Billing Structure

**Usage-Based Model:** We bill you for production instances based on three primary resources: CPU, memory, and storage.

-   **Hobby Instances:** Enjoy free usage with limited resources - perfect for development and testing.
-   **Production Instances:** Charged based on resource consumption. Below are the detailed costs:

Note: You can install and enable as many extensions and apps as you like in both hobby and production instances.

## Pricing Details

| Resource    | Cost per Hour | Cost per Month |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| 1 vCPU      | $0.07391      | $53.95         |
| 1Gi Memory  | $0.00549      | $4.01          |
| 1Gi Storage | $0.0002       | $0.146         |

-   **High Availability (HA):** Enabling HA for your instances doubles the resources allocated for redundancy, effectively doubling the cost. HA ensures higher uptime and reliability, particularly beneficial for critical applications.

-   **Users** You can add as many users as needed to your organization, without additional costs.

## Billing Cycle and Charges

-   **No Immediate Upfront Charges:** Changes in compute resources are billed at the start of the next billing cycle based on the previous period's resource hours.
-   **Multiple Instances:** All instances are aggregated into one invoice, broken down by instance.
-   **14-Day Free Trial:** New production instances come with a 14-day free trial (or up to $300 usage).

## Monitoring and Managing Your Billing

-   **Usage and Invoices:** Check your usage and view draft invoices on the Usage page in your profile.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>
<summary><b>Can I try it for free?</b></summary>
Our developer plan is free to use for as long as you want, with full access to apps and extensions. However, the hobby tier is limited to 0.25vCPU and 1Gi Memory. We also offer a 14-day free trial (up to $300 usage) on paid tiers for new accounts.

There are multiple ways to get support from our team. You can join our slack community, email us at <a href="mailto:support@tembo.io">support@tembo.io</a>, or use the Intercom “message us” feature on our website. We respond to most messages within 24 hours (and often faster!).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How is pricing for Tembo cloud calculated?</b></summary>
You can see the pricing in the pricing details section. Pricing is calculated based on instance size (compute, memory, and storage) and HA (if enabled). If you have both hobby and subscription instances, you will only be charged for the subscription instances.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What is my billing cycle?</b></summary>
We bill for usage on the first of each month, but if you’re interested in pre-payment or other payment schemes, email us at <a href="mailto:support@tembo.io">support@tembo.io</a>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I change my subscription level?</b></summary>
Upgrading from free to paid is easy, just select your desired instance size in the settings, then follow the prompts to add a credit card (if you don’t already have one on file). If your current storage is 10Gi, then you can downgrade by reducing your compute and memory to the hobby tier (0.25vCPU, 1Gi). If your current storage is greater than 10Gi, then your instance cannot be downgraded. We recommend just creating a new instance on the hobby tier, or contact us at <a href="mailto:support@tembo.io">support@tembo.io</a> for more detailed guidance.
