### Expanding our extension ecosystem for Postgres 14 and 16

At Tembo, we're proud to offer a wide array of extensions to enhance the capabilities of your Postgres instances. With 203 extensions for Postgres 15, 180 for Postgres 14, and 147 currently available for Postgres 16, our platform allows developers to tailor their database environment to their specific needs.

As we embrace the latest that Postgres 16 has to offer, we're also committed to expanding our support for extensions in this version. While not all of the extensions in our platform already support Postgres 16, our team is diligently working to close this gap. Our goal is to ensure that our users have access to a broad and diverse set of tools and features, no matter which version of Postgres they choose to work with.
