        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="An elephant holding a lantern" src="/assets/images/Lantern-f1fccf866e8953cbbee0c9a51211830d.png" width="2924" height="1332" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>Three weeks ago, we wrote a <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/postgres-vector-search-pgvector-and-lantern" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog comparing pg_vector and lantern</a> on index creation and search speed, and also mentioned that this is a fast evolving space with great momentum.</p><p>Just last week, we saw the release of Pgvector v0.6.0, which contains improvements in HWSW build time thanks to the ability to <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/issues/409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build indexes in parallel</a>.</p><iframe border="0" frameborder="0" height="400" width="600" src="https://twitframe.com/show?url=https://twitter.com/jkatz05/status/1752060288814420168"></iframe><p>And so, we had to try it out!</p><p>But then, while preparing the benchmark, I learned that Lantern can also build HNSW indexes in parallel via their external tool <a href="https://github.com/lanterndata/lantern_extras" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lantern-cli</a>.</p><p>So, this means that we can compare both extensions in a more fair manner. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="how-do-they-work">How do they work?<a href="#how-do-they-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do they work?" title="Direct link to How do they work?">​</a></h2><p>The invocation of the two indexers is different.</p><p>For Lantern we have to use the <a href="https://lantern.dev/blog/hnsw-index-creation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">external indexer</a>. It enables parallelism by spawning <code>N</code> additional threads (where <code>N</code> is determined by using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.available_parallelism.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>std::thread::available_parallelism</code></a>). From a quick look at the code, we can see that the main thread queries rows from the base table in chunks of 2K rows and sends them through a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/fn.sync_channel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sync channel</a>. At the other end of the channel, one of the <code>N</code> threads receives the rows and calls the appropriate <a href="https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">usearch</a> API to append them to the index.</p><p>In contrast, PgVector uses Postgres parallel workers. To activate the parallel build, we must set a value for <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#index-build-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>max_parallel_maintenance_workers</code></a>. Skimming through the code, we see that a parallel context is initialized with the target function <code>HnswParallelBuildMain()</code> and a dynamic shared memory segment (DSM). A portion of this segment is used as a shared scratchpad for the parallel workers. Each parallel worker scans a portion of the base table and executes a callback function to append a new element to the index in the shared area.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="a-quick-benchmark">A quick benchmark<a href="#a-quick-benchmark" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A quick benchmark" title="Direct link to A quick benchmark">​</a></h2><p>We ran a quick test with <code>parallelism = 8</code> to see how much things changed in terms of build time. Here are the results for <code>m={8, 16}</code>, <code>ef_construction=128</code> and <code>ef_search=128</code> with the sift-128-euclidean dataset. </p><p>This time I used:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Postgres Config</strong></td><td><code>maintenance_work_mem=8GB;  work_mem=2GB;  shared_buffers=12GB; max_worker_processes = 11; max_parallel_workers = 11</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>PgVector</strong></td><td><code>SET max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 7; -- plus leader</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lantern</strong></td><td>Max parallelism automatically detected by <code>lantern-cli</code> (8).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Docker Config</strong></td><td><code>cpu_limit=8; shm_size=9G</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The rest of the parameters are the same as the <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/postgres-vector-search-pgvector-and-lantern" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a>.</p><p>The following plot shows the new numbers along with the numbers we presented last time.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Baseline build time" src="/assets/images/001-baseline-build-time-732a50c0aa53c6fb5a446ab510041c7d.png" width="720" height="504" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>So, when multiple cores are used to create the indexes, Lantern continues to beat Pgvector in index creation time (36% faster for m=8, 31% faster for m=16).</p><p>I find it quite remarkable how both extensions improve the index creation time (3.98X-4.53X in Lantern, and 4.64-4.96X in Pgvector) when parallelism is used.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="try-it-out">Try it out!<a href="#try-it-out" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Try it out!" title="Direct link to Try it out!">​</a></h2><p>PgVector 0.6.0 is already available in <a href="https://tembo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo’s</a> <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/tembo-stacks/vector-db" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vector DB Stack</a>.

With <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_vectorize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg_vectorize</a>, an open source extension for Postgres, you have a seamless link to do vector search using over 120 open-source <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentence Transformers</a> from <a href="https://huggingface.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugging Face</a>, directly from Postgres.</p><p>pg_vectorize is completely open source, and you can run it locally or in your own environment by following the project’s <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_vectorize?tab=readme-ov-file#pg_vectorize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quick-start guide</a>. It is also available by default on the Tembo <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/tembo-stacks/vector-db" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VectorDB Stack</a> in <a href="https://tembo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Cloud</a> and can be added to any Tembo Postgres instance.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="what-are-sentence-transformers">What are sentence-transformers?<a href="#what-are-sentence-transformers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are sentence-transformers?" title="Direct link to What are sentence-transformers?">​</a></h2><p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence models ultimately perform mathematical operations. So if you have raw text and want to build a machine learning or AI application, you need to find a way to transform text to numbers. There has been detailed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> in this field, and  the resulting transformer models encode the meaning behind the raw text data into an array of floats. Once you have the array of floats (also called vectors or embeddings), now you can perform efficient mathematical operations such as vector similarity search and other forms of machine learning. <a href="https://www.sbert.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SentenceTransformers</a> is also the name of a popular open-source Python library that provides a simple interface to transformer models, and it is used in this project.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="picking-the-right-sentence-transformer-for-your-use-case">Picking the right sentence transformer for your use case<a href="#picking-the-right-sentence-transformer-for-your-use-case" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Picking the right sentence transformer for your use case" title="Direct link to Picking the right sentence transformer for your use case">​</a></h2><p>While OpenAI’s embedding API endpoint is commonly used, there are over <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">120 open-source</a> sentence transformers available on Hugging Face. The right model to use depends on your data and your use case. For example, the <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-MiniLM-L12-v2</a> model is a general purpose transformer useful for a wide variety of use cases such as training a supervised classification model or performing similarity search. Conversely, the <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-dot-v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-dot-v1</a> model was built specifically for semantic search.</p><p>Model selection is a large area of research, so experimenting with transformers is highly recommended. Different models have different constraints on inputs, and produce different dimensionality of outputs. Theoretically, larger outputs can encode more information, but that is an area of active research. The tradeoff with larger dimensionality embeddings is that they require more storage and longer query times. Read more in <a href="https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sbert's list of pre-trained models</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="direct-sql-hooks-to-hugging-face-sentence-transformers-via-pg_vectorize">Direct SQL hooks to Hugging Face sentence transformers via pg_vectorize<a href="#direct-sql-hooks-to-hugging-face-sentence-transformers-via-pg_vectorize" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Direct SQL hooks to Hugging Face sentence transformers via pg_vectorize" title="Direct link to Direct SQL hooks to Hugging Face sentence transformers via pg_vectorize">​</a></h2><p>pg_vectorize allows you to use any of Hugging Face’s sentence transformer models via SQL.

requirements than Postgres. For example, many transformers benefit immensely from a GPU, or massive amounts of CPU and memory. Therefore, it makes sense to run the embedding transformers on a separate host from Postgres itself, which does not natively require a GPU. So in our example, when you run <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_vectorize/blob/main/docker-compose.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>docker compose up</code></a>, the transformer models are running in a separate container than Postgres. This gives you the flexibility to run the transformers wherever you want, so long as pg_vectorize is able to establish a network connection with the container running the transformers.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="containers" src="/assets/images/containers-c320242c83c9f3c3e7966b37814bb7bb.png" title="containers" width="850" height="344" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>In Tembo Cloud, we run this workload on Kubernetes and manage it with the <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/tree/main/tembo-operator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tembo-operator</a> instead of <code>docker-compose</code>. This gives us the flexibility to assign and change the compute allocated to the transformer container.</p><p>The container hosting the transformers is a simple python http server built with FastAPI running the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/sentence-transformers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SentenceTransformer</a> library. It saves general-purpose all-MiniLM-L12-v2 model in the image, so when the container starts the model is immediately loaded into memory. When you call the container for any other model, it is downloaded and cached on the fly.</p><p>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_vectorize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo</a>, give it a star, then run <code>docker-compose up</code> to get started.

We wanted to quickly answer questions like "How many Postgres instances have we deployed?", "Who is our most active customer?" and "How many signups do we have by time?". In order to do this, we needed to bring data from several sources into a single location and keep it up-to-date so we could build the dashboards.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="tembo-dashboard" src="/assets/images/tembo_metrics-81a84fd44df51f1b585df45d7dfecf3c.png" title="tembo-dashboard" width="2572" height="554" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>Typically, this process requires several orchestration tools and technologies and the end result is a highly complex data ecosystem. However, we built our customer data warehouse completely on Postgres by using foreign data wrappers and other Postgres extensions, enhancing efficiency and simplifying the process. We released all the tools we've built as open source projects which you can host on your own using our <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/tree/main/tembo-operator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes Operator</a>. We also made it straightforward for anybody to build such a data warehouse on <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Cloud</a> by using the <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/blob/main/tembo-operator/src/stacks/templates/data_warehouse.yaml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Data Warehouse</a> stack.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="loading-data-from-several-sources">Loading data from several sources<a href="#loading-data-from-several-sources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Loading data from several sources" title="Direct link to Loading data from several sources">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="task" src="/assets/images/task-297f518bef76679cf410069587e6eb4a.png" title="task" width="1060" height="577" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>To build our data warehouse at Tembo, we first needed to pull our operational data into Postgres from several external sources, namely:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postgres</a> - We run a dedicated Postgres cluster (called "control-plane") to store all metadata for our customer's Tembo instances. This database contains information like cpu, memory and storage specs of instances, when the instances were created, their names, the organization it belongs to etc. We also run a message queue in Postgres using <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pgmq</a>, which contains an archive of historical events from the system.</li><li><a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prometheus</a> - Prometheus stores our usage metrics such as cpu and memory usage which are exported from across our infrastructure including Postgres and Kubernetes.</li><li><a href="https://clerk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clerk.dev</a> - We partner with Clerk to provide authentication and authorization for all our customers, as well as management of our users' organizations.

There are lots of tools in the ecosystem to help with this task. Many organizations bring in external tools, and vendors to handle this complexity. Tools like <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airflow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dbt</a>, <a href="https://www.fivetran.com/blog/modern-data-warehouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fivetran</a>, <a href="https://dagster.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dagster</a> are very popular, and outstanding projects, but using them comes at a huge cost.</p><p>Every time we bring in a new technology into the ecosystem, it becomes a piece of software that needs to be learned, mastered and maintained. This becomes a huge cost in the form of cognitive overhead for the team in addition to the time and resources it takes to set up, manage and maintain it. The system also gets expensive and much harder to debug due to the sheer number of tools involved. Many software systems today consist of far too many tools and technologies for any human to keep in their head. Some engineers at Uber spoke briefly about this <a href="https://youtu.be/zQ5e3B5I-U0?t=81" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently</a>.</p><p>So, rather than bring in new tools, we decided to use Postgres extensions to do the work for us. As a developer, extensions feel natural, like installing and importing a module or package from your favorite repository, which is much lighter and easier to manage than a completely new tool.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="connecting-postgres-to-sources">Connecting Postgres to sources<a href="#connecting-postgres-to-sources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Connecting Postgres to sources" title="Direct link to Connecting Postgres to sources">​</a></h2><p>Now, how do we get the data from all these sources into Postgres? We already knew we could use <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/postgres-fdw.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">postgres_fdw</a> to connect our data warehouse and control-plane Postgres instances. But, we were not certain how we could do the same for our data in Prometheus and Clerk. Prometheus had <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/monitoring-with-prometheus-fdw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several projects already available</a>, but none of them were a good fit for our use-case. Clerk.dev did not have any existing extensions for Postgres, so we decided to <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/clerk-fdw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build our own</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="an-intro-to-foreign-data-wrappers">An intro to Foreign Data Wrappers<a href="#an-intro-to-foreign-data-wrappers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to An intro to Foreign Data Wrappers" title="Direct link to An intro to Foreign Data Wrappers">​</a></h3><p>Foreign data wrappers (FDW) are a class of Postgres extensions which provide you with a simple interface that connects Postgres to another data source. If you've worked with Kafka, this is similar to 'Connectors'. There are many different foreign data wrappers available, and you can even write your own. Additionally, the <a href="https://github.com/supabase/wrappers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wrappers</a> framework makes it very easy to develop FDWs in Rust.</p><p>So, we built two new FDWs using the Wrappers framework to connect to those sources; <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/clerk_fdw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clerk_fdw</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/prometheus_fdw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prometheus_fdw</a>.</p><p>Working with FDWs is a fairly consistent experience. We'll walk through the process for how we set up <code>clerk_fdw</code>, but it is similar for <code>prometheus_fdw</code> and <code>postgres_fdw</code>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="setting-up-clerk_fdw">Setting up clerk_fdw<a href="#setting-up-clerk_fdw" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Setting up clerk_fdw" title="Direct link to Setting up clerk_fdw">​</a></h3><p>First - run the create extension command. For developers, this might feel a lot like importing a module, and I think that is a good analogy. We also need to create the foreign data wrapper object itself.</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_D5yF"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sql codeBlock_RMoD thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_AclH"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">CREATE</span><span class="token plain"> EXTENSION clerk_fdw</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">CREATE</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">FOREIGN</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">DATA</span><span class="token plain"> WRAPPER clerk_wrapper</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">handler</span><span class="token plain"> clerk_fdw_handler</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  validator clerk_fdw_validator</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_aaMX"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_z5j7" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_FoOz"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_L0B6"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Next, we create a server object.

our data warehouse stays up to date. To do that, we use a popular job scheduling extension <a href="https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg_cron</a>. If you're familiar with the unix utility "cron", then pg_cron is exactly like that but all within Postgres.</p><p>We create a function to refresh our data sources, then we tell pg_cron to call that function on a schedule. Working with pg_cron is very intuitive: we simply provide a name for the job, a schedule, and the command to execute. This is a lot like creating a job to execute some code you wrote using Apache Airflow or Dagster.</p><p>For example, we can simply create a function to delete and re-populate our cluster metadata from the control-plane, then schedule it to run every 5 minutes. Note that this is just an example but can be easily modified to UPSERT only newer or updated clusters.</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block"

href="#partitioning-with-pg_partman-for-performance-and-easy-expiry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Partitioning with pg_partman for performance and easy expiry" title="Direct link to Partitioning with pg_partman for performance and easy expiry">​</a></h2><p>Partitioning is a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">native feature</a> in Postgres, and it is the logical splitting of one table into smaller physical tables. Some, but not all of the tables in our data warehouse have grown quite large. Largest being our metrics, and this presents two problems that must be addressed; performance and storage. The majority of our dashboard queries aggregate data over time, and most commonly on a daily interval. So, we can partition our tables by day, and only query the partitions we need to answer our questions. This provides a substantial improvement to the performance of those queries which makes our dashboards very snappy.</p><p>Partitioning in Postgres is a batteries-not-included experience, which means you need to handle the creating, updating, and deleting of partitions yourself. That is, unless you use the <a href="https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg_partman</a> extension.</p><p>Our stakeholders do not require visualization for the entirety of our metric data, in fact they are typically only concerned with a 30 days at most. So, we can automatically drop partitions that are older than 30 days by setting up a retention policy and reclaiming that storage. Dropping a partition is much faster than deleting rows from a table and also skips having to deal with bloat. As we'll see in a moment, it is trivial to configure partitioning on Postgres if you use pg_partman (which is my personal favorite Postgres extension).</p><p>Creating a partitioned table just like creating a regular table but you have to specify a partition column. One caveat, is that we must create an index on the column that we want to partition by. In our case, we want a new partition for every day, so we partition by the <code>time</code> column, then create an index there as well. We use partitioning in other places at Tembo as well, and we wrote a bit about those use-cases earlier this year in <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/table-version-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another blog</a>.</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div

David has made significant contributions to Postgres, including <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/citext.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CITEXT2</a>, the case-insensitive data type; <a href="https://pgtap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pgTAP</a>, a database test framework; and <a href="https://sqitch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sqitch</a>, a database change management system. While an Associate at <a href="https://pgexperts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostgreSQL Experts</a> in 2011, he created <a href="https://pgxn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PGXN</a>, the original extension distribution system. His most recent stint was designing and building <a href="https://justatheory.com/2023/10/cipherdoc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a searchable, encrypted data store on PostgreSQL</a> for <a href="https://nytimes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>.</p><p>David will be focusing on <strong>evaluating the challenges of Postgres extension discovery and distribution and work towards a community solution to address them</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="challenges-of-the-postgres-extension-ecosystem">Challenges of the Postgres Extension Ecosystem<a href="#challenges-of-the-postgres-extension-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Challenges of the Postgres Extension Ecosystem" title="Direct link to Challenges of the Postgres Extension Ecosystem">​</a></h2><p>Extensions are arguably the most powerful capability of Postgres.</p><iframe border="0" frameborder="0" height="300" width="600" src="https://twitframe.com/show?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fadamhendel%2Fstatus%2F1734877766334456052"></iframe><p>They allow you to add to and replace critical components of the database without changing a single line in core. In terms of functionality, they range from simple <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/semver/doc/semver.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data types</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/uuid-ossp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">functions</a> to <a href="https://github.com/citusdata/citus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distributed databases</a> and <a href="https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLOps platforms</a>. But why don’t more developers use extensions?</p><p>Among many reasons, a noteworthy few stand out:</p><ul><li>Extensions are hard to find and discover: There isn’t a single easily searchable and navigable place for developers to easily find all extensions.</li><li>Extension maturity is difficult to judge: Developers have to rely on heuristics such as GitHub stars, name recognition, binary packaging distribution, and so on.</li><li>There is no centralized binary package repository for all platforms: Some extensions have no binary packaging while others are available via yum or apt. Managed services allow easy installation but most only support a limited number of extensions.</li><li>There is insufficient documentation and metadata on how to get an extension working successfully. Some require updates to <code>shared_preload_libraries</code>, some depend on other extensions or binary libraries, while others require specific configurations to be usable.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="trunk-binary-packaging-and-metadata-capture-for-extensions">Trunk: Binary packaging and metadata capture for extensions<a href="#trunk-binary-packaging-and-metadata-capture-for-extensions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Trunk: Binary packaging and metadata capture for extensions" title="Direct link to Trunk: Binary packaging and metadata capture for extensions">​</a></h2><p>To solve this problem, we built <a href="https://pgt.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trunk</a>. Trunk has a registry of 190+ extensions, their binary packages (for Ubuntu/Debian) and metadata that allows us to deploy them programmatically on <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Cloud</a>. We’ve also built a website at pgt.dev to let developers explore a categorized catalog of extensions and discover new ones.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="trunk" src="/assets/images/trunk-d452ad27c944d2beb3fd1e5de690974f.png" title="trunk" width="2634" height="1462" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>While Trunk works well for Tembo Cloud, we see a need for a better solution for the Postgres community in general. Extension developers should be able to upload their extensions, enjoy automated binary packaging and testing for different architectures and operating systems, and capture more metadata.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="pgxn-and-collaboration-with-david">PGXN and collaboration with David<a href="#pgxn-and-collaboration-with-david" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to PGXN and collaboration with David" title="Direct link to PGXN and collaboration with David">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="pgxn" src="/assets/images/pgxn-87528278366b39a1683d49f7e5ebfeef.png" title="pgxn" width="2054" height="1832" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>PGXN is the original Postgres extension registry. It distributes ~375 extensions and 400+ developers already publish extension source code distributions via PGXN. It also hosts extension documentation, allowing for comprehensive search. Still, PGXN lacks some features we believe to be important, including binary packaging (which is even more essential in the era of Rust extensions), automated indexing of extensions from GitHub, and a more modern user interface.</p><p>When David gave feedback on Trunk in its early days, we recognized his enduring passion to build on the PGXN foundation and take it to completion. David was also inspired by newer patterns exemplified by <a href="https://pkg.go.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pkg.go.dev</a> and <a href="https://crates.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crates.io</a>, and driving a community project to improve the extension ecosystem.</p><p>Today, we’re pleased to announce that David has joined Tembo to work on this initiative full time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="what-are-we-working-on">What are we working on?<a href="#what-are-we-working-on" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are we working on?" title="Direct link to What are we working on?">​</a></h2><p>To start with, we’re not immediately changing anything in PGXN or Trunk. Rather, the goal is to build a community-driven Postgres extension management solution that leverages components and learning from both. Our goals for the project are:</p><ul><li>Be the canonical source of record for all Postgres extensions</li><li>Be super easy for developers to publish their extensions in the ecosystem</li><li>Make extensions easy to find and understand</li><li>Make extension documentation consistent, standardized, and comprehensive</li><li>Provide stable, easy-to-use, and comprehensive APIs that downstream developers can use to build other tools and products</li><li>Provide automatic binary packaging for wide variety of platforms</li><li>Provide intuitive, powerful interfaces for managing extensions</li></ul><p>It’s been 3 weeks since David joined and we’ve already drafted a comprehensive vision document, which we will share in upcoming days. We’ve also initiated conversations with maintainers of other Postgres extension registries, to get their input and collaborate with them to work toward extension nirvana. If you’re interested in learning more about this or want to be involved, please reach out to us and we’d be happy to collaborate! It’s a big undertaking and we need all the help and feedback we can get 🙂</p><p>We’re excited for what’s to come.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="tembo-ml" src="/assets/images/tembo_ml-a6154c77c6d540662d939e0fc8f290f2.png" title="tembo-ml" width="2924" height="1332" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>At <a href="https://tembo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo</a>, we're building a platform that gives developers a Postgres experience optimized for their application. Today's applications are growing in complexity, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs), but also due to classical supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML). For those who have been working in the ML space for a while, you know that the ML lifecycle is a complex process. Today we are launching the Tembo Machine Learning Stack to fight back at some of that complexity!</p><p>An ML platform consists of all the tools and systems to manage the lifecycle of data science and machine learning projects. That lifecycle is a continuous and iterative process, from defining a business problem through ML model development, deploying for inference, and continuous monitoring and analysis. This incredibly complex process can become a barrier to entry for many teams. That’s why we built the <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/tembo-stacks/machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo ML Stack</a>, which offers a Postgres configuration equipped with the tools to make ML lifecycle efficient and easy, all from Postgres. You can try it out today by signing up for <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Cloud</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="ml-ops" src="/assets/images/arch-00406129568038186beaaf80214f12d1.png" title="ml-ops" width="1180" height="940" class="img_SS3x"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="primer-on-ml-ops">Primer on ML Ops<a href="#primer-on-ml-ops" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Primer on ML Ops" title="Direct link to Primer on ML Ops">​</a></h2><p>Building an ML Platform can quickly go off the rails with creeping scope. Today, a lot of companies make the decision on whether to go with an all-in-one tool or bootstrap with best-in-class component solutions. If you’re new to ML, Google has some <a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great reference architectures</a>, and for each component in Google’s architecture, there is a start-up or framework that specializes in it.</p><p>The landscape for ML Ops overlaps with and is just as complicated as the <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/modern-data-stack-mess" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overall data ecosystem</a>. The hyperscaler cloud providers offer all-in-one solutions but typically have a high learning curve, poor developer experience, and lock you in to the cloud provider. Bootstrapping a solution with best-in-class components has the benefit of allowing you to iterate the growth of the platform, but comes at the cost of high complexity.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="ml-tools" src="/assets/images/ml_tools-757d9092eb51bd463a502ed4270a36b3.png" title="ml-tools" width="719" height="419" class="img_SS3x"></p><p><em>Source: <a href="https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/mlops-is-a-mess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mihail Eric, “MLOps Is a Mess But That's to be Expected</a>”</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="frictionless-ml-development-with-postgres">Frictionless ML Development with Postgres<a href="#frictionless-ml-development-with-postgres" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Frictionless ML Development with Postgres" title="Direct link to Frictionless ML Development with Postgres">​</a></h2><p>ML workflows are generally split into three phases; exploration, model training, model serving. Exploring data within Postgres is a familiar process to many scientists, developers, and engineers. But model training and serving models is often done outside of Postgres, requiring additional infrastructure and engineering work. Serving is typically done outside Postgres, whether it’s hosting a model HTTP server or the dreaded 'rewrite' of the model training from Python into another language. This often results in the people doing exploration and model training being different from the people who are responsible for serving the model, which leads to a lot of friction and inefficiency in the ML workflow.</p><p>The Tembo ML Stack brings the entire ML workflow into Postgres, making it easier to build and deploy ML models. It puts operations and model serving in the hands of the model developer. And with pl/python, you can write your Python transformations directly in Postgres.</p><p>The <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo ML Stack</a> ships with several extensions which enable you to build an end-to-end solution for machine learning applications:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostgresML</a> - a SQL API with hooks into the most popular Python machine learning libraries, and management of the trained model artifacts</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg_cron</a> - schedule cron jobs directly from Postgres</p></li><li><p><a href="https://postgrest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostgREST</a> - call functions in your database via external HTTP requests</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpython.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pl/python3u</a> - write functions in Python and execute them directly from Postgres</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="model-training-with-pgml">Model training with <code>pgml</code><a href="#model-training-with-pgml" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to model-training-with-pgml" title="Direct link to model-training-with-pgml">​</a></h2><p>Tembo Cloud comes pre-configured with the most popular open-source machine learning extension for Postgres: <a href="https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostgresML</a>.</p><p>You can use this extension to train both supervised and unsupervised models with SQL, while still using a workflow that feels comfortable to most scientists. Rather than building a data frame in R or Python, build a Postgres table with your training data. Then, pass that data into the train function from <code>pgml</code>. If you've worked with pytorch, xgboost, or scikit-learn, this is akin to <code>.train()</code> or <code>.fit()</code>. Training the model on Postgres uses the compute already provisioned for your database. There is no additional setup needed.</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_D5yF"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sql codeBlock_RMoD thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_AclH"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">SELECT</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">*</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">FROM</span><span class="token plain"> pgml</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">.</span><span class="token plain">train</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    project_name </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">'clickbait_classifier'</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">algorithm</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">'xgboost'</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    task </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">'classification'</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    relation_name </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">'click_train_array'</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    y_column_name </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">'is_clickbait'</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    test_sampling </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">'random'</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_aaMX"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_z5j7" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_FoOz"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_L0B6"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="a-model-registry-native-to-postgres">A model registry native to Postgres<a href="#a-model-registry-native-to-postgres" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A model registry native to Postgres" title="Direct link to A model registry native to Postgres">​</a></h2><p>A model registry is vital in a ML platform, as it centralizes model management, enhancing organization and accessibility.

This is a great way to share your model with other teams, or to integrate it into your existing applications where establishing a database connection is not possible. Initializing PostgREST is as simple as clicking a button in the Tembo Cloud UI, but it is also available via our API and Terraform provider.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="postgres"

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="An elephant holding a lantern" src="/assets/images/Lantern-f1fccf866e8953cbbee0c9a51211830d.png" width="2924" height="1332" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>Vector search in Postgres is a space that has seen very active development in the last few months. While Pgvector is known to most people, a few weeks ago we came across Lantern, which also builds a Postgres-based vector database. So, we thought about benchmarking both to compare the two approaches. In this post, we'll cover:</p><ul><li>Quick background on doing vector search in PostgreSQL.</li><li>Comparing Pgvector and Lantern in terms of syntax and ease of use.</li><li>Benchmarks comparing index creation time, size, latency, throughput, and recall.</li><li>Summary of the results</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="intro-to-vector-search-in-postgresql">Intro to Vector Search in PostgreSQL<a href="#intro-to-vector-search-in-postgresql" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Intro to Vector Search in PostgreSQL" title="Direct link to Intro to Vector Search in PostgreSQL">​</a></h2><p>One of the reasons for the popularity of Vector Search these days has to do with the emergence of powerful <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/pgvector-and-embedding-solutions-with-postgres/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">embedding models</a> and their use in AI. You have probably witnessed how many people, startups, and big companies are <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/secure-embeddings-in-postgres/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exploring</a> how to take advantage of vectors and incorporate them into <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=vector%20search&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=story" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their products</a>.</p><p>Such enthusiasm has also attracted the Postgres community. <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pgvector</a> arose with the ability to create <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/vector-indexes-in-pgvector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVVFlat indexes</a> on existing tables with a simple DDL statement. And so, people were given the ability to easily perform similarity queries. </p><p>But Pgvector is not the only one in this space. The community has come up with other alternatives as well. One such example was <a href="https://github.com/neondatabase/pg_embedding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg_embedding</a>. In July, <a href="https://neon.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neon</a> published a <a href="https://neon.tech/blog/pg-embedding-extension-for-vector-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> where they showed how its extension was 20x faster than Pgvector by using HNSW indexes . However, Pgvector quickly caught up and introduced the HNSW index as well. Around that time, on September 29th, Neon stopped supporting <code>pg_embedding</code> and suggested migrating to Pgvector.</p><p>Another Postgres extension in the vector search domain is <a href="https://github.com/lanterndata/lantern" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lantern</a>, developed by a <a href="https://lantern.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">company of the same name</a>. In October, a <a href="https://lantern.dev/blog/hnsw-index-creation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on their blog claimed that their extension could outperform Pgvector by 90x in index creation time. That was an outstanding achievement!</p><p>So, I spent some time playing with Lantern, and I'd like to share some of my findings in this blog post. I divided it into two parts: the first one is a quick qualitative comparison, and the second one is a quantitative comparison using a popular benchmark. </p><p>Let's dive in.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="pgvector-vs-lantern-similarities-and-differences">PGVector vs Lantern: Similarities and differences<a href="#pgvector-vs-lantern-similarities-and-differences" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to PGVector vs Lantern: Similarities and differences" title="Direct link to PGVector vs Lantern: Similarities and differences">​</a></h2><p>The following table summarizes some aspects of both extensions:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th><strong>Pgvector</strong></th><th><strong>Lantern</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Current Version (date)</strong></td><td>v0.5.1 (Oct 10, 2023)</td><td>v0.0.11 (Dec 16, 2023)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Repo popularity (# of stars)</strong></td><td>7.6K</td><td>435</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Index Type</strong></td><td>IVVFlat, HNSW</td><td>HNSW</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Distance Metrics</strong></td><td>L2, Inner, Cosine</td><td>L2, Cosine, Hamming</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sample Index Creation</strong></td><td><code>CREATE INDEX ON items USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);</code></td><td><code>CREATE INDEX ON small_world USING hnsw (vector dist_l2sq_ops) WITH (M=2, ef_construction=10, ef=4, dim=3);</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sample Query</strong></td><td><code>SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embedding &lt;-&gt; '[3,1,2]' LIMIT 5;</code></td><td><code>SET enable_seqscan = false; SELECT * FROM small_world ORDER BY vector &lt;-&gt; ARRAY[0,0,0] LIMIT 1;</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>My takeaway is that if you are familiar with one of the extensions, you can easily understand how to use the other. No major complications are expected on that front.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="leveraging-ann-benchmarks">Leveraging ANN-Benchmarks<a href="#leveraging-ann-benchmarks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Leveraging ANN-Benchmarks" title="Direct link to Leveraging ANN-Benchmarks">​</a></h2><p>For a quantitative comparison, I took the <a href="https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ANN-Benchmarks</a> and <a href="https://github.com/binidxaba/ann-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended it</a> to support the Lantern extension. It was just a matter of creating a copy of the Pgvector directory, naming it Lantern and making a few adjustments to use the corresponding API.</p><p>The benchmark starts a container that has Postgres 15 installed and then it enables the corresponding extension. Then, it inserts a dataset into a table and builds a vector index (in both cases an HNSW index). After that, it executes a bunch of queries and evaluates the recall.</p><p>Along the way, the benchmark collects several metrics, such as:</p><ul><li>Build Time</li><li>Index Size</li><li>Recall</li><li>Throughput</li><li>Latencies (p50, p95, p99 and p999)</li></ul><p>So, we can compare the two extensions along these axes.</p><p>As for the HNSW parameters, I used the following:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>ef_construction</strong></td><td>{<!-- -->[128]<!-- -->, 200}</td></tr><tr><td><strong>m</strong></td><td>{<!-- -->[8, 16,]<!-- --> 24}</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ef_search</strong></td><td>{10, 20, 40, 80, 120, <!-- -->[128,]<!-- --> 200, 400}</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="comparing-index-creation-recall-latency-and-throughput">Comparing Index Creation, Recall, Latency and Throughput<a href="#comparing-index-creation-recall-latency-and-throughput" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Comparing Index Creation, Recall, Latency and Throughput" title="Direct link to Comparing Index Creation, Recall, Latency and Throughput">​</a></h2><p>Although I tried different datasets, for brevity, let us only discuss the results of the SIFT 128 dataset, which was also used in one of <a href="https://lantern.dev/blog/hnsw-index-creation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lantern’s posts</a>.</p><p>These are the numbers I got by following the instructions in the blog post, using similar construction and search parameters (e.g. <code>m={8, 16}</code>, <code>ef_construction=128</code> and <code>ef_search=128</code>). Here I used Lantern’s external indexer. First, let us see the build time:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Baseline build time" src="/assets/images/001-baseline-build-time-7c632f322362aa15e95e829397e989a2.png" width="720" height="504" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>Pgvector takes between 1.71x and 1.73x to build the same index with the same parameters. The resulting index is between 13% and 15% bigger in Pgvector:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Baseline index size" src="/assets/images/002-baseline-index-size-08e5d84d731f3f71fadb313df835c2ee.png" width="720" height="504" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>That’s cool… And what about the resulting throughput, latency and recall? Here are the results:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Baseline recall" src="/assets/images/003-baseline-recall-eb5abd0db814db937ed0191ab9333bb4.png" width="720" height="504" class="img_SS3x">
<img loading="lazy" alt="Baseline throughput" src="/assets/images/004-baseline-qps-4e9a3422c6bdc5593befe8255a5ea2f9.png" width="720" height="504" class="img_SS3x">

Specifically, Pgvector can process between 44% and 53% more queries per second, and it's latencies are between 29% and 35% smaller.</p><p>So, it seems that Lantern sacrifices throughput in exchange of index creation time and index space.</p><p>Hold on… but is this true for other data points as well? Let’s see.</p><p>With the construction parameters <code>m = {16, 24}</code> and <code>ef_construction = {200}</code>, the creation time is still better with Lantern: between 1.9X and 2.3X. And the resulting index is bigger in Pgvector: between 1.13X and 1.20X compared to Latern’s index.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Build time" src="/assets/images/011-sift-build-time-0348fd18902848f2c32e65766990cd3e.png" width="720" height="504" class="img_SS3x">

This is the graph for construction parameters <code>ef_construction=200</code> and <code>m=16</code>. As the <code>ef_search</code> is increased, the recall of both indexes get closer.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Recall" src="/assets/images/013-sift-recall-m16-6774b0b16726e717427af20dca6ce3ff.png" width="720" height="504" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>Pgvector has 62-84% better throughput and 38-45% better latencies:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Throughput" src="/assets/images/014-sift-qps-m16-864fda19f68fe4654166a60128ca103b.png" width="720" height="504" class="img_SS3x">

You can see more results <a href="https://github.com/binidxaba/lantern-pgvector-comparison/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="conclusions">Conclusions<a href="#conclusions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusions" title="Direct link to Conclusions">​</a></h2><p>For convenience, the following table summarizes the above results using relative numbers (i.e. <code>pgvector/lantern</code>):</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th><strong>m={8,16};  ef_construction=128;  ef_search=128</strong></th><th><strong>m={16,24};  ef_construction=200;  ef_search=<!-- -->[10-400]</strong></th><th><strong>Notes</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Build Time</strong></td><td>1.71X-1.73X</td><td>1.92X-2.35X</td><td>Lantern yields better results</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Index Size</strong></td><td>1.13X-1.15X</td><td>1.13X-1.20X</td><td>Lantern yields better results</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Latency</strong></td><td>0.64X-0.70X</td><td>0.54X-0.69X</td><td>Pgvector yields better results</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Throughput</strong></td><td>1.44X-1.53X</td><td>1.42X-1.84X</td><td>Pgvector yields better results</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Recall</strong></td><td>1.00X-1.01X</td><td>1.00X-1.09X</td><td>Recall is similar, Pgvector is slightly better</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Pgvector is the most popular Postgres extension for vector search. At the time of this writing, the github repository counts 7.6K stars and is actively being discussed on the web. It is also supported on most managed Postgres providers (including <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Cloud</a>) so is easier for you to access.</p><p>Lantern is a young project that leverages the popular <a href="https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USearch engine</a>. As of today, the extension has been starred more than 400 times in github and is in very active development. </p><p>Both extensions offer similar API and support the HNSW index. According to my experiments (Pgvector 0.5.1 and Lantern 0.0.11), Lantern's index creation is faster and produces smaller indexes. However, Pgvector provides better recall, latency and throughput.</p><p>We should keep an eye on both projects and see how they evolve. I am confident that we'll see several improvements in the following months.</p><p>Oh, and if you are interested in quickly integrating vector searches in your app, make sure to check out <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/introducing-pg_vectorize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg_vectorize</a> to see how to do that with only two function calls in Postgres. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="appendix">Appendix<a href="#appendix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Appendix" title="Direct link to Appendix">​</a></h2><p>The experiments in this post were carried out using a machine with the following characteristics:</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>VM</strong></td><td>E2-standard-8 (8 vCPUs, 4 cores, 32GB memory)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>100GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Operating System</strong></td><td>Debian 11.8</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Postgres</strong></td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Postgres Config </strong></td><td><code>maintenance_work_mem=5GB; work_mem=2GB; shared_buffers=12GB</code></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lantern</strong></td><td>0.0.11</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PGVector</strong></td><td>0.5.1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For information about other results, please see <a href="https://github.com/binidxaba/lantern-pgvector-comparison/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s cut right to the chase: the problem with your OLTP database actually doesn’t have anything to do with the database.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let’s cut right to the chase: the problem with your OLTP database <em>actually</em> doesn’t have anything to do with the database.</p><p>Your OLTP database is great.</p><p>The problem…is all the <em>other</em> stuff required in order for that database to solve your problem. In order for your application to work, you have to maintain a ridiculous pile of tools, add-ons, and services (with all their corresponding vendors). In practical terms, that means instead of having one thing to manage and build, you actually have <em>multiple</em>, all of which means more headache, effort, and cost. At Tembo, we believe that your database—the “OLTP stack”—should be ready to go. It should be a rock-solid solution, not more problems.</p><p>Want to see how it works? Check it out here as Darren gives us the tour:</p><div style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-bottom:56.25%;margin-bottom:5%"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:10px;width:100%;height:100%" width="900" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ys7l7WhlV6Y?si=9lkAlIuMd240kluY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>So what does that mean for you today? Simple. There are 3 key components that can make or break your OLTP database, and Tembo provides all three.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="1-extension-accessibility">1. Extension Accessibility<a href="#1-extension-accessibility" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Extension Accessibility" title="Direct link to 1. Extension Accessibility">​</a></h2><p>As we said at the beginning, the power—and complexity—of your OLTP database isn’t in the database itself. The complexity comes in all the extensions and other add-ons that are necessary for your specific use case—identifying, vetting, integrating, and managing them becomes just one more headache standing between you and the job you’re actually trying to run. But with the Tembo OLTP stack, we take all that headache off your plate.</p><p>First, we enable a couple of key extensions right out of the box and give you easy access to other commonly needed ones:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="extensions" src="/assets/images/extensions-8a5b4419716eaf01897e21bc44a672cb.png" title="extensions" width="1236" height="772" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>We also give you access to the full Tembo extension library—nearly 200 Postgres extensions and growing, all accessible in a single click. Need one that we currently don’t support? Just add it to our open source Trunk project, which makes it available in Tembo cloud. With the Tembo OLTP database, it’s simple for you to customize your stack to the exact use case you need.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="2-integrated-apps">2. Integrated Apps<a href="#2-integrated-apps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Integrated Apps" title="Direct link to 2. Integrated Apps">​</a></h2><p>This extension integration is powerful, but often your database will need more than just extensions. The Tembo library also includes a growing suite of applications that sit alongside your Postgres instance:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="apps" src="/assets/images/apps-28d11a448b8c9b5ac3163d862300d951.png" title="apps" width="1082" height="674" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>These powerful tools run on dedicated compute resources (which preserves your database performance) and are managed by Tembo Cloud alongside your Postgres instance (which ensures consistent accessibility and security). This means that you get the capability needed for your specific use case without the hassle of having to manage additional services or vendors.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="3-instant-performance">3. Instant Performance<a href="#3-instant-performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Instant Performance" title="Direct link to 3. Instant Performance">​</a></h2><p>Finally, let’s come back to the database itself. Typically, you’d expect to have to do a sizeable amount of tuning and optimization for your brand new database, but we’ve taken that headache off your plate as well. WAL settings are optimized, and we’ve set fairly aggressive autovacuum settings. We think of this as an “opinionated” OLTP setup. We’re setting you up to get to work right out of the gate; we believe that you shouldn’t have to spend hours tinkering with your settings just to get the performance levels you expect. Put simply, we give you master-level database performance without <em>you</em> having to become a database expert.</p><p>So what does this mean for you? It means that you can focus on what you’re building instead of on your database.

        <updated>2024-01-03T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generating external embeddings—using OpenAI, for example—is a risk.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Generating external embeddings—using OpenAI, for example—is a risk.</p><p>It’s a reasonable, logical risk—one that many of us willingly embrace when it comes to vector search and other AI-powered operations. However, the fact remains that it is still a <em>risk</em>. In order to make use of OpenAI embeddings, your data has to leave your secure environment; for many of our organizations, that risk simply isn’t on the table.</p><p>Which means that if you want vector search, you’re stuck building, managing, and orchestrating the whole thing yourself…until now anyway.</p><p>At Tembo, we recently released a new version of <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_vectorize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg_vectorize</a> and talked about how you can use it to perform vector searches using <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/introducing-pg_vectorize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just two commands</a>. Simple, straightforward, and powerful, this method checks all the boxes for a lot of us, but relies on OpenAI for the embeddings. Today, we want to show you an alternative that keeps all your data safely within your Postgres instance, but with that same <code>pg_vectorize</code> simplicity and convenience.</p><p>Interested? Thought so. Darren walks us through it right here:</p><div style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-bottom:56.25%;margin-bottom:5%"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:10px;width:100%;height:100%" width="900" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv6PPDcG25A?si=CrUwdxa12aOGODyl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Let’s dig in a little more.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="vector-search-simplified">Vector Search, Simplified<a href="#vector-search-simplified" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Vector Search, Simplified" title="Direct link to Vector Search, Simplified">​</a></h2><p>As we mentioned earlier, our original reason for creating pg_vectorize was to simplify this vector search process. If you’re using Postgres, there’s no reason why you should have to employ multiple tools, manage external services, or bring on extra vendors just to make vector search possible. We took that long, complex process you’ll find in most “how to create vector search” how-to articles and automated it.</p><p>With Tembo, once your instance is created (and check out the <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/tembo-cloud/getting_started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs</a> if you need help with that), you can build your vector search query in just two commands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What you have all of that data over here in your Postgres database.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What you have: all your monitoring data and analytics stored over <em>there</em> in Prometheus.<br> What you’d <em>like</em> to have: all of that data over <em>here</em> in your Postgres database.</p><p>Having it all in Postgres would be simpler, easier to keep an eye on, and easier to do something with. But up until now, you couldn’t. At Tembo, we ran into this exact same problem ourselves—we wanted to be able to bring our own monitoring data back into our systems to allow for advanced time-series data queries and management.</p><p>So we built the thing that we needed—a one-of-a-kind integration of Prometheus monitoring data into Postgres. This integration is not just about simplifying data workflows; it's about offering a smarter, more efficient way to manage data.</p><p>Want to see how it works? Darren shows us the ropes:</p><div style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-bottom:56.25%;margin-bottom:5%"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:10px;width:100%;height:100%" width="900" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LVuH4RtNQss?si=N95sY1J1fyM7oFbp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><br> What sets this integration apart? It's the only current, fully supported solution of its kind. It enables querying for Prometheus metrics directly within Postgres, bridging the gap between Prometheus monitoring and Postgres's robust database capabilities.<p>Let us show you how to get up and running:</p><p>We’ll start by going to the Tembo Cloud UI, clicking the extensions tab, and installing the prometheus_fdw extension in our instance.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="installImage" src="/assets/images/installImage-3e89255097f2714c3372c178ef4cfa60.png" title="installImage" width="1778" height="950" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>Once that’s installed, we can enable the extension, and we’re ready to go. If you’re new to working with foreign data wrappers, it’s important to know that once the extension is enabled, you’ll then need to actually create the foreign data wrapper within your database, like

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Tembo, we support the things we believe in.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Tembo, we support the things we believe in.</p><p>It’s why we’re committed to the OSS movement—it’s not just that we like Postgres (we do), but that we genuinely believe that the open-source approach is <em>better</em>. We believe it creates a better ecosystem for us all to work in, it creates a better framework for innovation, and most of all, it just creates better projects.</p><p>Projects like <a href="https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostgREST</a>.</p><p>For those that aren’t familiar, PostgREST is a fantastic open source project for generating a RESTful API from any existing Postgres database. Like most developers and teams, we quickly ran into a situation where we had applications that we needed to be able to talk to one another. As a company, we needed a stable, flexible API solution—and immediately had to wrestle with how to handle it. Do we build our own? If we did, we could ensure it was stable and safe, but we’d be reinventing the wheel. If we used someone else’s, it would save on work, but introduce more risk.</p><p>And like many of you, we found PostgREST and realized the problem was solved.</p><p>In fact, we loved it so much that we became a sponsor—like we said at the beginning, we support the things we believe in. Beyond that, we’ve integrated it into Tembo cloud as an app that users can enable with a single click because we want them to be able to benefit from the PostgREST team's fantastic work.</p><p>Want to see an example? No problem — Darren walks us through how it works:</p><div style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-bottom:56.25%;margin-bottom:5%"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:10px;width:100%;height:100%" width="900" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YuXaJreVyrw?si=0EQ07nNFhz-9qSww" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>For more, keep reading or check out our <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/tembo-cloud/application-services/REST-API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="no-saas-just-one-step">No SaaS, Just One Step<a href="#no-saas-just-one-step" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to No SaaS, Just One Step" title="Direct link to No SaaS, Just One Step">​</a></h2><p>Let’s start with the Tembo Cloud UI–we’ll be using an instance that we’ve just set up, and if we go to the new “Apps” tab, we can enable PostgREST (among others, more to come on that!) with a single click. This also works with instances that are already up and running—you don’t have to decide ahead of time, and it’s still just a single click to enable.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="enableApp" src="/assets/images/enableApp-8328c9208774feddbc291eca17433bab.png" title="enableApp" width="1680" height="948" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>Now that it’s up and running, let’s see how it actually works. This instance we created has some data in it, and we will need a token to connect to it. We’ll set that token as a variable in our shell, along with the org id and instance id:</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block"

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>That’s right. You could have vector searches running on your existing Postgres database in less time than it takes to read this blog. Let’s see how it works:</p><div style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-bottom:56.25%;margin-bottom:5%"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:10px;width:100%;height:100%" width="900" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TgtINeeucy8?si=7jBlRi59mSnlnH0i" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Intrigued? Let’s take a look at the bigger story. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="vector-solutions-arent-solving-anything">Vector “Solutions” Aren’t Solving Anything<a href="#vector-solutions-arent-solving-anything" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Vector “Solutions” Aren’t Solving Anything" title="Direct link to Vector “Solutions” Aren’t Solving Anything">​</a></h2><p>There are many vector “solutions” just a Google search away—Chroma, Pinecone, Redis, Postgres, and more, all fighting for your attention. Lots of people have written about using Postgres in particular as the storage layer for your vector data, and we agree with them. Unfortunately, these solutions still leave you with a <em>lot</em> to do. </p><p>First, you get to figure out how to generate, store, update, and manage your embeddings. Loads of blogs out there that will coach you through the process of building an embeddings application in python, javascript, or your language of choice. You’ll be walked through the process of pulling data out of your database, transforming it in memory, orchestrating a few API calls, then inserting that data back into the database. Maybe you’ll bring in some fantastic tools like Dagster or Airflow to help run this on a schedule. Now you get to monitor that process and hope it doesn’t break, or otherwise you get to hire a team to keep it healthy. Congratulations, you now have embeddings for your data—you’re halfway there!</p><p>Now you get to build <em>more</em> software. See, your existing data is set up, but you need a way for your application to search it. When a user enters something like “mobile electronic devices” into their search bar, your application will need to transform that raw text into embeddings, using precisely the same algorithm that you applied to your existing data. In other words, you get to repeat the process we just did for the entire table except now you’re doing it for the user’s request. That will give you embeddings for the text query.</p><p><em>Finally</em>, you can use those embeddings to search the data in the table.</p><p>So are all these providers and “solutions” actually making things easier? It sure doesn’t seem like it. We think there’s a better way.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="introducing-pg_vectorize-only-two-calls">Introducing pg_vectorize: Only Two Calls<a href="#introducing-pg_vectorize-only-two-calls" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introducing pg_vectorize: Only Two Calls" title="Direct link to Introducing pg_vectorize: Only Two Calls">​</a></h2><p>Remember at the beginning how we said you could set up vector searches on Tembo Cloud in 60 seconds? No way you’re doing that with the long, convoluted process we just described—so we automated it. On Tembo Cloud, the whole process of setting up and managing vectors for a given table is done with an open source extension we built named pg_vectorize, using a single Postgres function call: </p><div class="codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_D5yF"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_RMoD thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_AclH"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">SELECT vectorize.table(</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    job_name =&gt; 'product_search',</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    "table" =&gt; 'products',</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    primary_key =&gt; 'product_id',</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    columns =&gt; ARRAY['product_name', 'description'],</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">);</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_aaMX"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_z5j7" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_FoOz"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_L0B6"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>So what happened here? Remember that ultimately, vectors are just arrays of floats that we're going to do linear algebra on. So we created a job, called it “product_search”, on an existing table called “products”. We want our user search queries to look at “product_name” and “description”. Tembo’s platform handles transforming these two columns into embeddings (via OpenAI embeddings endpoint) for you, and continues to monitor the table for changes. When there’s changes, embeddings are updated. The data is stored using pg vector’s vector data type, and indexed using pg vector HNSW index.</p><p>It’s as simple—actually simple—as that. One call, and we’re ready to search. </p><p>See, Postgres lets us create our own indexes via extensions, which enables us to do that search with one more SQL function call. We reference the job name we set up in the last step, provide the raw text query, and specify which columns we want returned and the number of rows. Think of this as a “select product_id, product_name from products where product_name and product_description are similar to 'our query'”.</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_D5yF"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_RMoD thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_AclH"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">SELECT * FROM vectorize.search(</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    job_name =&gt; 'product_search',</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    query =&gt; 'accessories for mobile devices',</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    return_columns =&gt; ARRAY['product_id', 'product_name'],</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    num_results =&gt; 3</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">);</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_aaMX"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_z5j7" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_FoOz"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_L0B6"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Then we get our results, along with the cosine similarity score for each records. </p><div class="codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_D5yF"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_RMoD thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_AclH"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                                         search_results                                         </span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> {"product_id": 13, "product_name": "Phone Charger", "similarity_score": 0.8564774308489237}</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> {"product_id": 24, "product_name": "Tablet Holder", "similarity_score": 0.8295404213393001}</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> {"product_id": 4, "product_name": "Bluetooth Speaker", "similarity_score": 0.8248579643539758}</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">);</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_aaMX"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_z5j7" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_FoOz"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_L0B6"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>No management, no migrating data, no extra services or teams to hire.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every area of the modern data landscape is absolutely flooded with VC-funded data tools. Your inbox is crammed full of marketing emails from reps offering to demo great new software. You <em>already</em> have more tools at your disposal than you need. And worst of all, you probably have a gnawing suspicion that there are better tools—maybe even a better <em>way</em>—out there somewhere.</p><p>Good luck finding it though. You’re stuck digging through the chaotic sprawl of the modern data stack, which looks something like this, right?</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="map1" src="/assets/images/map1-dee4f14a563ee4f85c0d6c668af6cb73.png" width="1495" height="840" class="img_SS3x">
<em>Source: <a href="https://lakefs.io/blog/the-state-of-data-engineering-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LakeFS, "The State of Data Engineering 2022"</a></em></p><p>Well, that’s one way to look at it. The reality is actually something more like this:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="mad2023" src="/assets/images/mad2023-858ad46edba70c6d43ce2f5df08dcfeb.png" width="2900" height="1500" class="img_SS3x">
<em>Source: <a href="https://mattturck.com/landscape/mad2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Turck, "The 2023 Machine Learning, AI, and Data (MAD) Landscape"</a></em></p><p>Put simply, the modern data stack looks less like a plan and more like a Jackson Pollock painting.</p><p>So how did this crazy bloat all come about? It’s a layered origin story, but it started with increased lower-barrier-to-entry VC funding due to ‘cheap’ capital from ZIRP (Zero-Interest Rate Policy) coming out of COVID. This in turn, generated an overwhelming number of companies with access to funding. YCombinator alone now generates hundreds of new data companies each batch. As more and more of these companies have fragmented the stack into ever-smaller slices, the overall landscape has gotten exponentially more complex. Of course, they start simple—often with just one core feature. But then they metastasize, sprawling out to provide adjacent features, all to bolster an aggressive 'land and expand' sales strategy. You buy a data warehouse tool, and before you know it, they're tacking on data transformation or dashboarding capabilities. Soon enough, these tools begin to overlap, their secondary features clashing, and your teams are running similar workloads in multiple, redundant places.</p><p>In larger organizations, the bloat becomes outright contagious. Different data teams end up using different tools to isolate their tribe, and data becomes increasingly siloed. To combat this fragmentation and reduce the errors that stem from siloed workflows, companies buy even more software for data monitoring, providence, lineage, cataloging, and pipelining. Monitoring and data quality assurance is necessary regardless of the complexity of your stack, but the more tools you use, the higher the risk. A bloated data stack goes hand-in-hand with increased costs and complexity, and creates an urge for new teams to try to silo away from the mess (which, ironically, only makes it worse).</p><p>No single person or company is really to blame for the overabundance of data tools. It’s not your CTO or engineering manager’s fault that the database is sprawling, or that you’re struggling to figure out how to manage your relational, NoSQL, MapReduce, cloud, columnar, wide column, object-oriented, key value, hierarchical, document/JSON, text search engine, message queue, graph, vector, and time series databases all at once. On top of it all, vendors are perpetually on the hunt for new territory (and they’re very good at selling/upselling their stuff), so Frankenstacks are somewhat inevitable. And it’s not all bad news - competition in the database solutions space has driven major sophistication. But the inevitable consequence that we all now face is major complexity.</p><p>So what do we do about it? At Tembo, we want to offer <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/tembo-manifesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a different solution</a>. Simply doing the same thing—adding more vendors to the sprawl—isn’t solving <em>anything</em>.</p><p>We believe the solution—Postgres as a data platform rather than just a database—has been right in front of us all along. It’s time to take an entirely new approach.</p>]]></content>

And to us, the message queue workload is an OLTP workload in disguise. And while we're excited about our recent release of PGMQ v1.0, we're not getting ahead of ourselves. We know the truth—nobody gets all <em>that</em> excited about a message queue...which got us wondering: “What <em>could</em> you do to make it interesting?” The overwhelming answer?</p><p>Make it fast. Like...Twitter-scale. (Sorry, X.)</p><p>So what would that look like? Let’s take a look.</p><div style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-bottom:56.25%;margin-bottom:5%"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:10px;width:100%;height:100%" width="900" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4vK0JqCNuok?si=60cxZCsfiYEiIiNm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Before we get into the rest of that story, it’s worth calling out what’s in <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PGMQ v1.0</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Stable API</strong>: Main API functions have matured to support backwards compatibility.</li><li><strong>Object Membership Model</strong>: All PGMQ objects now live in the PGMQ schema.</li><li><strong>Relaxed Compiling Requirements</strong>: Improved portability by moving some functions to PL/PGSQL.</li><li><strong>Added Unlogged Queue Type</strong>: Introduced unlogged queue type which significantly improves performance at the expense of durability.</li><li><strong>Updated Documentation</strong>: All SQL API functions are now documented in public docs.</li></ul><p>So back to the test–let’s have a look at what happened.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="postgres-is-faster-than-youd-think">Postgres is Faster Than You’d Think<a href="#postgres-is-faster-than-youd-think" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Postgres is Faster Than You’d Think" title="Direct link to Postgres is Faster Than You’d Think">​</a></h2><p>The concept is simple: we built a notification system that triggers events based on tweets on X. For each tweet, the application will receive a minimal payload (something like <code>{"username": "elvis"}</code>). On average, there are approximately 6,000 tweets per second; but at peak, traffic can hit nearly 150,000 messages per second.</p><p>(That’s a lot of hot takes.)</p><p>We then set up a queue to buffer those events, and attached consumers to process the messages in the queue and send our notifications. Many publishers writing small messages in batches of 100. Many consumers each processing messages, also in batches of 100. Massive throughput. Can Postgres handle 6,000 messages per second with peaks over 150,000?</p><p>In short, Twitter-scale.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="22bytes" src="/assets/images/22bytes-b41d2bb4b08430efc9019d6bfa9e2c32.png" title="22bytes" width="2952" height="2292" class="img_SS3x"></p><p><em>large batch, micro message size throughput</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="how-did-we-build-it">How Did We Build It?<a href="#how-did-we-build-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Did We Build It?" title="Direct link to How Did We Build It?">​</a></h2><p>Using the Tembo Cloud Message Queue Stack, we were able to write over <strong>150k messages per second</strong>, by running 20 concurrent writers each publishing batches of 100 messages. On a single Postgres instance running 16vCPU and 32GB of memory, and sustain <strong>reading up to 30k messages per second</strong>, by running 10 concurrent consumers each reading 100 messages per batch.</p><p>We made several <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/blob/702802a4627539c13654414def423c6b9f9b3b79/tembo-operator/src/stacks/templates/message_queue.yaml#L95-L121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">configuration changes</a> to Postgres itself to achieve this, including aggressive autovacuum settings and scaling shared_buffers to 60% of system memory.</p><p>Obviously, this is an absurdly large amount of volume that most users do not need to support, and the conditions in this benchmark are specifically tuned for this workload:</p><ul><li>Message size is very small at 22 bytes</li><li>Producers are writing in batches of 100, which is close to optimal for the amount of system memory, and shared_buffers configuration</li><li>Consumers are reading in batches of 100</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="its-not-just-twitter-scale">It’s Not Just Twitter Scale<a href="#its-not-just-twitter-scale" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to It’s Not Just Twitter Scale" title="Direct link to It’s Not Just Twitter Scale">​</a></h2><p>Message queues are a common need, though most of the time we’re dealing with less volume and larger message sizes. 1000 bytes is a more reasonable measure and is what has been <a href="https://www.galiglobal.com/blog/2021/20210430-Three-Kafka-good-practices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recommended</a> when using Apache Kafka. So what happens to the benchmark when we try it with larger messages? Short version–it’s still surprisingly speedy, especially when we tune for this new workload.</p><p>Larger messages means more time to transmit data across the network, and more memory usage in Postgres, particularly on the batch inserts. As expected, the write throughput (using the same compute level) drops off as the message size increases. We decreased write batch size from 100 to 10, and unsurprisingly saw write throughput decrease from 160k/s to 30k/s. However, at this level of messages incoming to the queue, 10 consumers each reading 100 messages at a time can keep queue size down and process at roughly the same rate, 30k/s.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="1kb" src="/assets/images/1kb-2fe363a4acbd2b99560536b2082245fb.png" title="1kb" width="2952" height="2292" class="img_SS3x"></p><p><em>batch throughput for 1kb messages per second</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="single-message-throughput">Single Message Throughput<a href="#single-message-throughput" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Single Message Throughput" title="Direct link to Single Message Throughput">​</a></h2><p>What about the non-batch use case? Most user applications start by consuming and producing single messages at a time (or their clients provide a single message API)—let’s try concurrent producers each sending one message at a time paired with many consumers each reading one message at a time.</p><p>With 50 producers each sending 1 message at a time and 100 consumers each reading 1 message at a time, Postgres will be able to clear the queue at a rate of over 7k messages per second (even on a relatively small compute node 16vCPU and 32GB RAM), which is still higher than the average volume seen by Twitter in 2023. 7k messages per second is higher than most use cases/</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="single" src="/assets/images/single-c5dfe08a007db958d1b6deee8e099841.png" title="single" width="2952" height="2292" class="img_SS3x"></p><p><em>single message throughput for 1kb messages per second</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="resource-constrained">Resource constrained<a href="#resource-constrained" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Resource constrained" title="Direct link to Resource constrained">​</a></h2><p>But what if you’re resource constrained? Turns out we can go even smaller.</p><p>For a similar benchmark on a Tembo MQ instance running on 1vCPU and 4GB of memory, with messages sizes of about 1KB, 10 x producers and 10 x consumers each processes messages in batches of 5. Even with these constraints, Postgres is still able to process thousands of messages per second.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="micro" src="/assets/images/micro-be04c9f5f9b375d402bda3b4cd3fbae8.png" title="micro" width="2952" height="2292" class="img_SS3x"></p><p><em>micro batches on 1vCPU and 4GB memory</em></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="your-turn">Your Turn<a href="#your-turn" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Your Turn" title="Direct link to Your Turn">​</a></h2><p>The best part? Thanks to the Message Queue stack on cloud.tembo.io, this kind of performance can be at your fingertips today. No external services or complicated sprawl necessary—just a few key principles to set you up for success:</p><ul><li><strong>Proper indexes</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PGMQ</a> sets these up for every queue it creates.</li><li><strong>Working Memory</strong> - Configure Postgres to keep the entire queue in memory. <code>shared_buffers</code> is a big part of this; <a href="http://cloud.tembo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Cloud</a> dynamically configures this for you.</li><li><strong>Manage table bloat</strong> - aggressive auto vacuum configurations are set on all Tembo Message Queue Stacks</li><li><strong>Balance</strong> - It’s important to find the right balance of batch size and concurrency. We recommend starting with a single message read/write to help you get an initial benchmark.</li><li><strong>CPU and Memory</strong>- This should be tailored to the workload size. A 16vCPU goes a very long way.</li><li><strong>Queue Operations</strong> - For best results, the queue operations should be OLTP in nature. PGMQ’s write, read, delete and archive commands do exactly this.</li></ul><p>Try the MQ Stack on <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud.tembo.io</a> today and reach out to us in Slack, or on twitter.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="the-hardware">The Hardware<a href="#the-hardware" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Hardware" title="Direct link to The Hardware">​</a></h2><p>For the above benchmarks, Tembo MQ runs on Postgres 15.3 running in <a href="http://cloud.tembo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Cloud</a>, configured as the Tembo Message Queue stack. The message queue stack consists of several configuration changes to optimize for performance. The complete specification can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/blob/702802a4627539c13654414def423c6b9f9b3b79/tembo-operator/src/stacks/templates/message_queue.yaml#L95-L121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tembo-operator repository</a>. The most impactful configuration changes are to the autovacuum configurations (far more aggressive than default) and shared_buffers (75% of system memory) about 3x higher than recommended for most workloads. The intention is to keep the working set in Postgres memory so that we never have synchronous writes to disk. There is no connection pooler deployed between the benchmark client and Postgres, however there is AWS and Kubernetes network infrastructure. We’ve optimized Postgres for the Message Queue workload, which comes with the tradeoff that it will be less performant for other workloads. At Tembo, that's why we provide Stacks for every workload, and make it easy for you to move data in between your Postgres clusters.</p><p>The client executing our benchmark scripts runs on an EC2 instance c5.2xlarge in the same region as Tembo’s Postgres instance, <code>us-east-1</code>. Network latency is real, and we will measure with “select 1” latency in our plots. This is meant to provide a more realistic evaluation of Tembo’s MQ Stack. The benchmarks were conducted on two separate Tembo Message Queue instances, 1vCPU/4GB memory and 16vCPU and 32GB memory, and are noted in the benchmark results. Both instances run in Tembo Cloud, running on AWS EKS, and gp3 EBS volumes, all with 3000 provisioned IOPS. Benchmarks were conducted using a combination of <code>pgbench</code> and the Python benchmark application that lives in the PGMQ <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq/blob/293f6e93f3799ee17016b07f4834f7bd01f7387a/tembo-pgmq-python/benches/runner.py#L22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project repo</a>.</p>]]></content>

I'm Rye Walker, founder of Tembo, a managed Postgres company. And today I'm here with Tim Sehn from Dolthub. Tim, welcome to the show.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000030---tim">[00:00:30]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#000030---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000030---tim" title="Direct link to 000030---tim">​</a></h5><p>Thanks for having me.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000031---ry">[00:00:31]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000031---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000031---ry" title="Direct link to 000031---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, like to start, maybe you can give us a quick background. Where are you from, where'd you grow up, and what were you doing before Postgres?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000040---tim">[00:00:40]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#000040---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000040---tim" title="Direct link to 000040---tim">​</a></h5><p>So I'm Canadian. I grew up kind of around Canada. I went to the University of Waterloo. I graduated in 2003 and started my career at Amazon. It was a pretty small company. When I started. There were about 400 engineers there, so I think there's probably more than 400,000 engineers there now. So pretty fun place to work. Early days. Kind of grew up there. Left in 2013 to be the head of engineering at this tiny company called Snapchat. I was employee 18 there. I worked there for a little over four years. I left that job in 2017 and started this company. I've been doing that for a little over five years now.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000131---ry">[00:01:31]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000131---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000131---ry" title="Direct link to 000131---ry">​</a></h5><p>Cool. Do you remember when you first started using Postgres? I can't remember myself, but I'm curious.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000136---tim">[00:01:36]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#000136---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000136---tim" title="Direct link to 000136---tim">​</a></h5><p>If you remember it's interesting. We've used Postgres to back Dolthub initially, and I'll kind of explain what we're trying to do a little bit more, probably later, but I used it through interfaces. The first time that I got kind of deeply familiar with it is the initial version is MySQL compatible, not Postgres compatible. So apologize for that on this podcast. There's a reason for so obviously a lot of people through the five years that Dolt's been available have come and asked for a Postgres version. And we built a PG dump to MySQL dump converter that we also open sourced. And so I wrote a lot of tests for that and was bug fixing it. So that was kind of the first time I got deeply familiar with the Postgres syntax and ecosystem and actually probably ran it myself on my machine.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000247---ry">[00:02:47]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000247---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000247---ry" title="Direct link to 000247---ry">​</a></h5><p>Did you build Dolt, the original version while at another company, or did you go and just was it a startup from beginning of the project?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000256---tim">[00:02:56]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#000256---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000256---tim" title="Direct link to 000256---tim">​</a></h5><p>Well, so we started Dolthub because we wanted a place on the Internet to share data. And we thought that the reason one of those places didn't exist is because you couldn't branch and merge and clone and do all the things you could with databases that you could do source code. We started a company to do that, and we didn't start a company to build dolt was kind of the answer to that problem that we thought we would test.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000330---ry">[00:03:30]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000330---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000330---ry" title="Direct link to 000330---ry">​</a></h5><p>And so you started Dolt what year you say it was? 2017.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000336---tim">[00:03:36]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#000336---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000336---tim" title="Direct link to 000336---tim">​</a></h5><p>So I quit in 2017. I left Snapchat on Friday. I started this company on Monday. By Friday, I was like, I'm not sure I really want to do this right now. So I kind of kicked the startup along in the background, incorporated it, got all the bank account, tin number, all that kind of stuff. And then my two co founders, Aaron Bryant, left their jobs in June, July of 2018, and we started this on August 6 of 2018. So we've been doing it a little over five years.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000407---ry">[00:04:07]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000407---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000407---ry" title="Direct link to 000407---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. So have you raised venture capital?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000411---tim">[00:04:11]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#000411---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000411---tim" title="Direct link to 000411---tim">​</a></h5><p>Yes, we've raised $23 million. We have about 11 million left. That's awesome. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000421---ry">[00:04:21]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000421---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000421---ry" title="Direct link to 000421---ry">​</a></h5><p>This isn't one of those kind of calls.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000423---tim">[00:04:23]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#000423---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000423---tim" title="Direct link to 000423---tim">​</a></h5><p>Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000424---ry">[00:04:24]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000424---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000424---ry" title="Direct link to 000424---ry">​</a></h5><p>No, that's good. That's awesome. So when did you start integrating, I guess when did Dolt support Postgres? Rather than try to convert from.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000439---tim">[00:04:39]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#000439---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000439---tim" title="Direct link to 000439---tim">​</a></h5><p>So we just launched Doltgresql, a version of Dolt that uses a Postgres client to connect to it. It is not a Postgres extension, it's its own standalone database. And we can go into great detail about why that is. And that just launched on November 1.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000500---ry">[00:05:00]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000500---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000500---ry" title="Direct link to 000500---ry">​</a></h5><p>Awesome. How hard was it to make?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000503---tim">[00:05:03]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#000503---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000503---tim" title="Direct link to 000503---tim">​</a></h5><p>Well, so we've been thinking about the project for over a year, like planning, exploring foreign data, wrappers, a bunch of different techniques to pull this off. And we started the project for real in let's call it like, July 1. So to go from nothing to something like a very early Alpha launch was three or four months.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000535---ry">[00:05:35]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000535---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000535---ry" title="Direct link to 000535---ry">​</a></h5><p>Okay. So not terribly not a super long adventure to get there.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000543---tim">[00:05:43]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#000543---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000543---tim" title="Direct link to 000543---tim">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. The way it works is it implements the Postgres client protocol, and then it parses the SQL that comes in into an abstract syntax tree, and then it does a conversion of that abstract syntax tree to the type of abstract syntax that Dolt understands. And so then beyond that point, it's Dolt analyzer Dolt storage.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000615---ry">[00:06:15]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000615---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000615---ry" title="Direct link to 000615---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. So tell me about the is this storage sort of like files parquet or like yeah. How do you store the data?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000624---tim">[00:06:24]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#000624---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000624---tim" title="Direct link to 000624---tim">​</a></h5><p>Well, so that's the novel thing about Dolt. So we took a novel data structure from another open source project called Nons. They had built a content addressed B-tree, which they call a proletree. So at the core of every OLTP database, there's B-trees. The thing a content address B-tree gets you is that you can compare two of them in order time of the differences. So if they're the same right. They have the same root content address. If they're different, you walk the tree on both sides to find the different content addresses. And then at the leaves, that's where the data actually is. And then you can find the data that's actually different.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000709---ry">[00:07:09]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000709---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000709---ry" title="Direct link to 000709---ry">​</a></h5><p>So it's really like files. It's not like a data lake sort of structure. It's not a proprietary, but like a binary storage engine for right.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000722---tim">[00:07:22]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#000722---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000722---tim" title="Direct link to 000722---tim">​</a></h5><p>Those end up in what we call chunk files, zip chunk files on disk. But it is, from the ground up, proprietary, not open source storage format.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000733---ry">[00:07:33]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000733---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000733---ry" title="Direct link to 000733---ry">​</a></h5><p>Novel. How about novel?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000734920---tim">[00:07:34.920]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#000734920---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000734920---tim" title="Direct link to 000734920---tim">​</a></h5><p>Novel? Yeah, novel. Wrong word. And so with that data structure, most people listening to this podcast probably are aware that the core functionality that you need for version controlling anything is the ability to produce a fast diff. Because all the functionality that you use, like merge two of these things together, is all based on computing a diff and then applying the diff on either side of the merge. That's why it needs to be its own database, at least in the Postgres case we did explore it would need to be its own storage engine. It would like its own foreign data wrapped storage engine.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000825---ry">[00:08:25]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000825---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000825---ry" title="Direct link to 000825---ry">​</a></h5><p>Okay, so yeah, we should probably jump up one level. I realize now I know what Dolt is and you know what Dolt is, but we didn't exactly describe you said it's as if Git and MySQL had a baby, but it's now if Git and Postgres were MySQL had a baby.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000845---tim">[00:08:45]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#000845---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000845---tim" title="Direct link to 000845---tim">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. So Dolt is a version controlled SQL database. It's MySQL compatible, it launched 1.0 in May, so it's 99.99% correct against a suite of 6 million tests that SQL lodging test that SQL Lite built. It's about 1.1 times slower than MySQL on writes and about 2.2 times slower than MySQL on reads. And so it's got OLTP level performance, but it also has version control features. And so you can diff, branch, merge - all the Git idioms that you're used to in the SQL context. The write operations are exposed as procedures. So you would call Dolt checkout, for instance, call Dolt underscore checkout with argument. So it models the Git command line through procedures. The read operations are either exposed as system tables, custom system tables like Dolt underscore log, and then there's also some SQL functions. So if you want to diff two commits, for instance, you would call it diff and pass in the two commits and those would produce a table. So it's a table. Basically, there's these novel version control features on top of your standard SQL database. If you never make a Dolt commit, it looks exactly like a Postgres or MySQL database.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001021---tim">[00:10:21]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#001021---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001021---tim" title="Direct link to 001021---tim">​</a></h5><p>It's just a head, a single head.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001025---ry">[00:10:25]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001025---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001025---ry" title="Direct link to 001025---ry">​</a></h5><p>What are the use cases that you find getting the most traction on this? Where does it work? I guess, where are people loving it? And where is it perhaps not the right fit? I'm curious.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001038---tim">[00:10:38]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#001038---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001038---tim" title="Direct link to 001038---tim">​</a></h5><p>Our canonical customer, is this customer called Turbine. They do cancer cell simulations. A cancer cell simulation is about 50 to 100 gigs. They simulate about 50 different cancer cells. And before Dolt, they were putting their data in MongoDB. But as you can imagine, they have a number of researchers that are making changes at the same time to the data. And one canonical copy of the data wasn't enough for them to iterate fast on development. They use branches and merges and they'll have whole teams of researchers modifying a simulation, which usually means modifying the schema on a branch for six months. And then if that works better than the current one, they'll merge it in and so the way I describe it is anywhere where your configuration, your data is more like configuration that looks like code where you're building data. So like a catalog. We have a number of video game companies. So modern video games have many, many gigs of configuration, like the chest drop rate, the strength of this monster and putting that into Dolt and then using that as part of the development pipeline is a common use case.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001205---tim">[00:12:05]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#001205---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001205---tim" title="Direct link to 001205---tim">​</a></h5><p>The third use case is as a machine learning feature store. So whenever you build a model, you create a tag that's an immutable object. So then you can refer to that and get reproducibility or models based on that tag. And so those are the kind of the three core use cases. We wouldn't recommend it as like a high throughput, something to back a website. The features are less compelling there. Really you're talking about developer efficiency or the ability to recover from a bad query at the cost of some throughput. Eventually we think it's just a better mousetrap, but right now we'll take video game configuration future stores.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001257---ry">[00:12:57]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001257---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001257---ry" title="Direct link to 001257---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Are people using it? I don't know. I think of the Postgres foreign data wrapper, I could keep some of my data in a dolt table and sync it into my, let's call it my transactional database to productionize it, I guess. Have you seen any of that happening where people are or how do they get it into use, I guess well.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001329---tim">[00:13:29]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#001329---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001329---tim" title="Direct link to 001329---tim">​</a></h5><p>People run it as OLTP. Right. So it does have pretty good.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001336---ry">[00:13:36]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001336---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001336---ry" title="Direct link to 001336---ry">​</a></h5><p>Not.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001336---tim">[00:13:36]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#001336---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001336---tim" title="Direct link to 001336---tim">​</a></h5><p>Great, it's not perfect, but usually people just run it as their primary. But we do have customers that pull the data out and basically export and do a build process to put it in some sort of hot cache or something you can set up as a replica of MySQL. And so that just launched in early this year. So we have a couple of customers that basically in that mode. Every write transaction you make on your MySQL primary becomes a commit in Dolt. And so you get full log of every cell in the database, basically.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001419---ry">[00:14:19]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001419---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001419---ry" title="Direct link to 001419---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. I could imagine there'd be like certain tables that I might care to have history on. I guess there's different use cases for this, but if my use case was I want to have a good history of how this thing has changed, that would be one I love fast forks is another obviously important.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001443---tim">[00:14:43]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#001443---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001443---tim" title="Direct link to 001443---tim">​</a></h5><p>There's two levels of write isolation you can have. Right. You can make a branch, which means it's sitting there on your primary, but it's write isolated if you write to it. But if you make a long running query, that's obviously going to take up resources and potentially slow down your database. But you can also clone right, which is the decentralized way of doing it, which is what you're talking about. Like fast forking, which is like I just want a copy of this on my local desktop. I want to play with the data, do whatever I want to do with it. And Dolt supports both of those things.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001513---ry">[00:15:13]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001513---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001513---ry" title="Direct link to 001513---ry">​</a></h5><p>And then how important is I click on Dolthub and discover databases, and I see lots of databases, I don't know how many. It seems like an endless scrolling number of databases. Is this for demo? Or is this actually a big part of the value proposition to have public or semi public or just shared data published?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001537---tim">[00:15:37]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#001537---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001537---tim" title="Direct link to 001537---tim">​</a></h5><p>That's where we started. That's this problem we tried to solve. I think we might have been a little skipped a few steps, like version control of source code came out in the we only got really a thriving open source community, maybe late 90s. For a while, we built novel data sets using this process called data bounties, where we would publish schema and we'd say we'll pay $10,000 for any accepted we'll divide up $10,000 prize based on the amount of data that you submit. And so we've built like a very popular hospital price transparency data set. There is novel data on there. The place where we're starting to get a little bit of traction on data sharing is in stock market data. There's this guy post. <!-- -->[inaudible 00:16:36]<!-- -->  he's one of our early customers. He's been publishing for three or four years now. Rates, options, option pricing. So it's kind of more advanced databases than an update daily on stock market data. It's there. We think eventually it could be a big piece of what we do. It all works, but we kind of consider ourselves a database company, not a data company.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001704---ry">[00:17:04]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001704---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001704---ry" title="Direct link to 001704---ry">​</a></h5><p>Okay, cool. Yeah. So building the Postgres version of this, what were the biggest challenges you faced during that project?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001713---tim">[00:17:13]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#001713---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001713---tim" title="Direct link to 001713---tim">​</a></h5><p>Right, so we've been thinking about Postgres for a long time, obviously. I think maybe a better place to start is why is MySQL in the first place? Noms, the storage engine that we built on top of at first was written in Golang, and so Dolt itself was a command line program like Git. The idea was you would build it or you would download it and you'd run it like Git, you'd run Dolt ad where you'd run so it initially didn't have SQL, it was its own format. And then customers came and they're like, well, data is best expressed as SQL, both schema and I want to be able to query what's inside this thing. And so we wanted to add a SQL interface and Postgres. In the MySQL open source ecosystem, there's this project called Vitess, which is used by it's maintained by the folks at planet scale, which we love them. That's a pure Go implementation of the MySQL wire protocol and Parser. And so we could take Vitess. And then there was another open source project called Go, MySQL Server, which was a pure Go implementation of MySQL analyzer, and where you could plug with pluggable storage.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001848---tim">[00:18:48]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#001848---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001848---tim" title="Direct link to 001848---tim">​</a></h5><p>And so we could get a pure Go implementation of MySQL's wire protocol for basically Free. Now, it wasn't very correct, it was about 90% correct, but we could add it quickly and we could maintain Dolt as a Satal binary that you downloaded. Right. The deployment install story was very clear, whereas when we investigated how to do this with Postgres, it would have been something like a file based foreign data wrapper where you would have to install Postgres and then it would point it at like it would be a complicated install process for a user. It wouldn't be this seamless download a single binary, import your data, run SQL on. Our co founder Aaron is a huge Postgres fan. I think he was lobbying for Postgres, but the deployment story didn't really make sense at the time. Plus we were kind of considering SQL an add on, not the core feature. So that's why we chose MySQL Is for the deployment story since Dolt launched in August 2019. Obviously the first thing people, I want a Postgres flavor, I want an Oracle SQL flavor, I want a SQL Server flavor. So we've been talking about revisiting the file based foreign data wrapper approach.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002019---tim">[00:20:19]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#002019---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002019---tim" title="Direct link to 002019---tim">​</a></h5><p>I'd say the hardest project, the hardest part of doing Doltgres was figuring out how to do it. Was it going to be a file based foreign data wrapper? Was it going to be like a fork of Postgres itself? And there's reasons for that I can kind of get into. Or were we going to use Dolt's SQL Engine and storage and then just expose the Postgres flavor of SQL? So basically you connect with a Postgres client, but it's its own database, it's not Postgres. And so after some kind of deep investigation, we went with the last option, which is Doltgres is its own database, but it implements the Postgres flavor of information, schema, SQL, all that part. The reason for that was the way that Dolt exposes version control functionality is through procedures, custom system tables, and the extension interfaces that you have in Postgres were hard to modify in a way where we could keep the same version control interface. Right. So we had a hard time figuring out if it was a file based foreign data wrapper, how you would say switch branches, right. Or even maintain expose the concept of a branch to Postgres because Postgres doesn't really know what that is, doesn't expect that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002206---tim">[00:22:06]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#002206---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002206---tim" title="Direct link to 002206---tim">​</a></h5><p>And so there was a lot more that we would need to invent to be able to make it use the Postgres SQL.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002218---ry">[00:22:18]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002218---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002218---ry" title="Direct link to 002218---ry">​</a></h5><p>You said originally you thought the SQL interface was a secondary interface. Has it become the primary interface for most users? Or would you say that, yeah, we're.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002229---tim">[00:22:29]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#002229---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002229---tim" title="Direct link to 002229---tim">​</a></h5><p>A database company now? Part of the thing is, I'm not sure if people will be watching this, but I have gray hair. One of the things that you're taught as a software engineer is never build a database, right? So we tried to build a data sharing tool and got suckered into building a database. And so they so but that being said, now that we're deep on this journey and we have what we consider a production grade OLTP database, we're excited that we're there, right? And we think the world can be a better place for this. Certainly makes data sharing and open data much more feasible.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002323---ry">[00:23:23]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002323---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002323---ry" title="Direct link to 002323---ry">​</a></h5><p>And like, for a new Doltgres user, would you even mention the CLI? Or is it just like, that's more of a legacy interface? Or is it like, hey, maybe you want this too?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002341---tim">[00:23:41]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#002341---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002341---tim" title="Direct link to 002341---tim">​</a></h5><p>Well, we've made the conscious choice with Dolgres to not implement the Dolt CLI. All right? The user interface is very simple. You download it, you run Doltgres, it opens up port on 5432, and you connect a Postgres client to it, PGP SQL or whatever, and then you run SQL command. And so we think in the long run, the way we'll differentiate Dolt and Doltgres is Doltgres will be a version controlled database, and Dolt will be Git for data, which can also be a version controlled database. And so we find that customers, especially coming to these new concepts, they get confused fairly easily with the is it a command line? Should I use the command line? Should I use the SQL interface? And so with it's, it's just the SQL interface.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002444---ry">[00:24:44]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002444---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002444---ry" title="Direct link to 002444---ry">​</a></h5><p>Are there any big milestones coming up for Doltgres that you're looking forward to?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002450---tim">[00:24:50]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#002450---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002450---tim" title="Direct link to 002450---tim">​</a></h5><p>Absolutely. So one of the first questions we get asked is, okay, I love the features, I really want to use it. How's the performance? And so we've become very good at comparing MySQL and Dolt performance. So, as I said, Sysbench, we understand the MySQL knobs that we need to turn to make it perform the best or at least perform in a similar fashion to Dolt. And so I'm really excited to run those same Sysbench tests with Dolt against Postgres, because then we can kind of, by comparison, compare MySQL to Postgres, which I think is sort of an unanswered performance question. And so I'm both excited to see how Dolt does in comparison to Postgres, but I'm also very excited to kind of answer the question that I've had, which is like, which one of these databases is faster? And so I'm kind of excited to see how that comes out. And that should be Zach started first we're working on correctness tests and then performance tests are got it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002603---ry">[00:26:03]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002603---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002603---ry" title="Direct link to 002603---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it's a lot of work to do that stuff and do it right and make sure you're correct, right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002610---tim">[00:26:10]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#002610---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002610---tim" title="Direct link to 002610---tim">​</a></h5><p>No, it's one of these things. We were talking about this yesterday. We were. On yugobyte's. Website. They publish Sysbench test. A lot of people run Sysbench, but people don't run Sysbench. It's like, oh, on OLTP insert, it's 34 TPS on Sysbench, but on the same hardware, it doesn't give you a benchmark against, say, Postgres. And so you're like, okay, is that good or bad? You have a hard time. And the reason people don't do that is because setting up a database and putting on a bunch of different hardware and figuring out what the best way to kind of explain performance is fraught with peril. You open yourself up to being like, you didn't test it right.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002657---ry">[00:26:57]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002657---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002657---ry" title="Direct link to 002657---ry">​</a></h5><p>You could set up Postgres to be with a few tweaks of some variables. You can set it up to perform worse. Right. So the question is, did you tune your competitor as well exactly your own, like, no, I didn't tune my competitor as well as I tuned ours.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002713---tim">[00:27:13]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#002713---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002713---tim" title="Direct link to 002713---tim">​</a></h5><p>A good example for us is our benchmarks run on AWS on an EC2 host backed by EBS. And so it's a network attached disk. And that's because the way that we kind of explain that to customers is that, well, so, like, if you use hosted Dolt or AWS RDS to run MySQL or Doit, then that's kind of what you're getting. That's the architecture and that's kind of what most people use. Now, Dolt is far less sensitive to disk latency than MySQL. And so if you run the same sysbench tests on your MacBook, for instance, that has SSD, MySQL performs much better because it's more sensitive to disk latency. So this is the kind of thing that you're questions you're opening yourself up to answer. But these are all interesting things for people to know and to talk about. So I'm happy.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002819---ry">[00:28:19]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002819---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002819---ry" title="Direct link to 002819---ry">​</a></h5><p>So I noticed that the core project looks like it's patchy too. Has anyone else offered managed Dolt for MySQL?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002832---tim">[00:28:32]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#002832---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002832---tim" title="Direct link to 002832---tim">​</a></h5><p>Not yet. I would think we would consider that a win. That means it's popular enough and that people think they can make money off of hosting it. So that would be great. But yeah, no one does offer managed Dolt other than us.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002851---ry">[00:28:51]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002851---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002851---ry" title="Direct link to 002851---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, got it. Okay, well, good. I don't know if there's anything I should have asked that I didn't ask. I always like to ask people, like, do you listen to podcasts? And if so, what are your favorite podcasts? I'm a big podcast listener.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002908---tim">[00:29:08]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#002908---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002908---tim" title="Direct link to 002908---tim">​</a></h5><p>I've listened to a ton of podcasts. I've never driven my car to work in my career, so on my walking commute. Ever since the first generation ipod, I've been listening to podcasts. I'd say the early classic is econ talk. And then Bill Simmons. Those were the two that I kind of started with. And then over time, I've kind of phased out Econ Talk and more like Derek Thompson's. What's the name of that? You can search I forget the name of it, but it's another I don't.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002942---ry">[00:29:42]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002942---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002942---ry" title="Direct link to 002942---ry">​</a></h5><p>Know that one either.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002945---tim">[00:29:45]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#002945---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002945---tim" title="Direct link to 002945---tim">​</a></h5><p>I don't listen to very much tech podcasts. The other one that I've been doing recently is The History of Rome, which is like 200 hours or something, and I think I'm at Trajan, so that's like 120 Ad or something. So I got like 280 years left of Rome.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003005---ry">[00:30:05]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003005---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003005---ry" title="Direct link to 003005---ry">​</a></h5><p>That's awesome. Yeah, I like history podcasts, too. History that doesn't suck is one that I just recently discovered I'm listening to. Have you heard that? It's, like all about American history, so it's probably not very interesting to you.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003019---tim">[00:30:19]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#003019---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003019---tim" title="Direct link to 003019---tim">​</a></h5><p>Well, I'm American now. I live in Santa Monica, California. Dan Carlin is the king, but he only puts out, like, one podcast a year.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003030---ry">[00:30:30]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003030---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003030---ry" title="Direct link to 003030---ry">​</a></h5><p>So whenever I see that drop in.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003033---tim">[00:30:33]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#003033---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003033---tim" title="Direct link to 003033---tim">​</a></h5><p>My podcast, oh, it's immediate listen. Immediate listen. Well, the World War I one. I've never had a more enthralling podcast experience, I don't think. Yeah, mind blowing. I know.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003045---ry">[00:30:45]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003045---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003045---ry" title="Direct link to 003045---ry">​</a></h5><p>And it's so funny. I talk to my kids, I'm like, oh, yeah, just listen to a six hour podcast on Genghis Khan they're like, what are you doing? He's so great. So hardcore history. Everybody go listen to that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003102---tim">[00:31:02]<!-- --> - Tim<a href="#003102---tim" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003102---tim" title="Direct link to 003102---tim">​</a></h5><p>Next. The thing I'd ask the Postgres community to do is please tell us what you want from a version controlled Postgres. So the I know, like, Postgres is about as good as Dolt was for MySQL two years ago. And so we have a playbook to kind of get Doltgres to where Dolt is. But there's things we can prioritize. For instance, one of the things that we released later that we could do first is we could make Doltgres consume the write ahead log and just be like a version control replica of Postgres. And so we could run fast ahead on that and that sort of prioritize insert updates, correctness schema correctness over sort of the read path and make the read path more oh, it's like exploratory. And the idea there is like, the customer or operator runs a bad query on your primary you can find and writes continue. Right. You can literally isolate the query, create a patch patch back on your primary. Right, yeah. So that would be the one thing I would ask this audience to kind of and then also just star a repo. Tell us that you're interested in it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003248---ry">[00:32:48]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003248---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003248---ry" title="Direct link to 003248---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, good.

No, it got into the top ten on Hacker News, so it definitely drove a lot of traffic to the website and interest. It's got about 550 GitHub stars. Our main core project has about 16,000. The thing about it is our customer base has told us we're going to continue to invest in it. So it's really what percentage of the 16 people we have working on Dolt should I dedicate to Doltgres?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003338---ry">[00:33:38]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003338---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003338---ry" title="Direct link to 003338---ry">​</a></h5><p>Awesome. Well, it was great to have you on. This is actually episode ten, the last episode for the season. We're going to take a break over the holidays.

I'm Rye Walker, founder of Tembo, a managed Postgres company. And today I'm here with Bertrand Drouvot. And I know I said it poorly, but Bertrand, welcome to the show.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000034---bertrand">[00:00:34]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#000034---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000034---bertrand" title="Direct link to 000034---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Thanks for having me.

Where'd you grow up? I'm guessing it's France.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000049---bertrand">[00:00:49]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#000049---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000049---bertrand" title="Direct link to 000049---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yes.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000051---ry">[00:00:51]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000051---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000051---ry" title="Direct link to 000051---ry">​</a></h5><p>What were you doing before you started working on Postgres? I'm always curious to hear background.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000057---bertrand">[00:00:57]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#000057---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000057---bertrand" title="Direct link to 000057---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. So as you can hear, I am French. I grew up in the east of France. So before doing Postgres, I did about 20 years of Oracle DBA as a freelancer or working in some companies. And then I switched to Postgres about five years ago now and doing it as a full time job since about four years now.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000127---ry">[00:01:27]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000127---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000127---ry" title="Direct link to 000127---ry">​</a></h5><p>Awesome. Yeah. Do you remember when you first started using Postgres? I mean, you probably touched it earlier in your career, or was it really like a first touch just five years ago?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000138---bertrand">[00:01:38]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#000138---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000138---bertrand" title="Direct link to 000138---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it was really a first touch, like five years ago. Before that this was mainly Oracle but wanted to see something else and wanted to contribute one way or another, not using a black box. And so that's why I moved to Postgres.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000156---ry">[00:01:56]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000156---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000156---ry" title="Direct link to 000156---ry">​</a></h5><p>Do you like Oracle better than Postgres?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000200---bertrand">[00:02:00]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#000200---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000200---bertrand" title="Direct link to 000200---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>That's not the same, but I prefer Postgres because I can be involved in the new features, bug fix and all this kind of stuff.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000210---ry">[00:02:10]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000210---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000210---ry" title="Direct link to 000210---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. Awesome. Let's talk about some of your Postgres work. I know you've worked on pgsentinel, but yeah, I'd love to know what you've built in the past and then maybe what you're working on now. But we can start with the past.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000226---bertrand">[00:02:26]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#000226---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000226---bertrand" title="Direct link to 000226---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. So when I started to study Postgres, I was comparing with what I knew in Oracle, in the Oracle world, and I was like something like active session history was not there. And I was like, so let's try to build this. And this is how pgsentinel came up. So it's an extension that record active session. So it's pulling regularly active session from pgstat activity. You can define the sampling period and as well as the number of record to retain. It's in-memory ring buffer. And before PG 14, I think the query ID was not present in pgstat activity. So I had also to make use of, I think the <!-- -->[inaudible 00:03:18]<!-- -->  analyze hook to get the query ID and to show this up so that in every pgsentinel record you see what the session was doing and which query ID was associated at the time of the sampling.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000333---ry">[00:03:33]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000333---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000333---ry" title="Direct link to 000333---ry">​</a></h5><p>It's interesting. We're literally building dashboards right now and I think we need pgsentinel, perhaps because I'm like, I want to know the history of the sessions. Does it get exposed? I don't know. Are people getting this data pushed out via because like we we consume all these metrics from Postgres via Prometheus. I wonder. You said it's stored in memory, but how do I access that besides running a query, I guess.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000406---bertrand">[00:04:06]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#000406---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000406---bertrand" title="Direct link to 000406---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, so there is basically a view on top of the in-memory ring buffer. So you can query the data and I guess you can push it to Prometheus.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000417---ry">[00:04:17]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000417---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000417---ry" title="Direct link to 000417---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah. Okay, I think I just found a solution to a problem by inviting you to the podcast. Thanks. Are you actively working on that or is that pretty much completed? What are you working on these days?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000436---bertrand">[00:04:36]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#000436---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000436---bertrand" title="Direct link to 000436---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, so for <!-- -->[inaudible 00:04:37]<!-- -->  it's more ensuring you know when there is a new measure, ensuring it compiles and still works as it should and no more than that, and fixing bugs when they are reported. I also wrote another extension which is a pg_orphaned, could be useful to detect or find files. I mean in Postgres it's easy to create orphaned files. You just begin create table, insert some data and crash the server. Then you will get orphaned files so the extension detects the orphan files. Then you can move them to a backup directory and verify everything is still okay and then delete them or push them back in the original directory if anything went wrong. It also takes care of existing transaction using a dirty snapshot so that you can see transactions that have started but not committed yet. So that you don't move files that are part of any active transaction. And another one that is funny is pg_directpaths. It enables to do insert bypassing the share buffer and writing directly to disk. It has performance benefits because at the end you do less work. I mean you don't need to find a free buffer and all this stuff you just write to disk. And also it generates less <!-- -->[inaudible 00:06:13]<!-- -->  because it only flush <!-- -->[inaudible 00:06:17]<!-- -->  images by a bunch during that time.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000621---ry">[00:06:21]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000621---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000621---ry" title="Direct link to 000621---ry">​</a></h5><p>Interesting. I'm curious the origin of these extensions, like for example pgsentinel. Like for know, you work at AWS, right? Are you on like the RDS team? I'm curious how it's organized. Are you working directly on the features of that or are you working with customers trying to use those RDS and Aurora?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000647---bertrand">[00:06:47]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#000647---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000647---bertrand" title="Direct link to 000647---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yes. So currently I am part of the RDS contributor Postgres team, which our role is mainly to contribute to upstream fixing bugs and provide new features.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000659---ry">[00:06:59]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000659---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000659---ry" title="Direct link to 000659---ry">​</a></h5><p>Got it. Okay. But like Sentinel, was that something that RDS team wanted or was that like a customer, what caused you to decide to work on that? Or was it like your own idea? Like, hey, you just personally wanted it to exist. I'm curious, like the origin of the project.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000717---bertrand">[00:07:17]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#000717---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000717---bertrand" title="Direct link to 000717---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. So for pgsentinel, I was even not employed by AWS at that time. I did it when I started to learn Postgres, in fact, because I like to learn doing something and just not reading books or whatever.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000734---ry">[00:07:34]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000734---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000734---ry" title="Direct link to 000734---ry">​</a></h5><p>Got it. All right, that's cool. Yeah. So are you building extensions for Postgres as part of your, I get like you're contributing to the core project, but is the extension work similarly just your own personal interests or is it related to making the RDS platform better?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000758---bertrand">[00:07:58]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#000758---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000758---bertrand" title="Direct link to 000758---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>I guess, yeah. So pg_orphaned is an extension that is being used internally because we see orphaned files, so we have to deal with them. And so that's why this extension has been built. pg_directpaths. It was more for fun and to mimic an oracle feature that is allowing direct path insert.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000827---ry">[00:08:27]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000827---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000827---ry" title="Direct link to 000827---ry">​</a></h5><p>Going back to building your first extension, what challenges were you faced with? What was hard about it?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000835---bertrand">[00:08:35]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#000835---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000835---bertrand" title="Direct link to 000835---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it was not that easy. So first of all, there is a lack of kind of template. You have to find an existing extension and try to, I mean, at least that's what I have done, try to understand how the existing extensions works and try to find documentation around it. I think it was not that easy. I think it is going better with pgrx because now it kind of provides an initial template so you can start building on top of this. But yeah, it was not that easy at the beginning.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000912---ry">[00:09:12]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000912---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000912---ry" title="Direct link to 000912---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. Would you use pgrx and Rust to build your next extension? Or, I don't know, maybe you're a hardcore C++ guy and prefer that. I'm curious, what's your thought on that?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000927---bertrand">[00:09:27]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#000927---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000927---bertrand" title="Direct link to 000927---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, so the last one I built, I built it in C and in Rust, just because I am newcomer in Rust and I wanted to learn Rust and pgrx as well. So yes, I started to learn about it. So I think maybe there is some limitation in Rust. So it all depends what you need to do for memory management and this kind of stuff. Maybe it's more difficult outside of the C world for Postgres.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000954---ry">[00:09:54]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000954---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000954---ry" title="Direct link to 000954---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think I've talked to Eric about not everything has been exposed in pgrx, so you may have to... If you're doing something super deep, it may not have the right hooks for you.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001007---bertrand">[00:10:07]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#001007---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001007---bertrand" title="Direct link to 001007---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>But the cool thing is there is module that you can rely on. So it's easy if you want to interface with someone else's work well.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001020---ry">[00:10:20]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001020---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001020---ry" title="Direct link to 001020---ry">​</a></h5><p>The other thing I think it brings is that a standardized template that helps a new extension developer, you don't have to go hunt for one similar to yours. I imagine you probably spent some energy like trying to look at all the different extensions to find the right pattern, the close enough pattern to borrow. Yeah. So are there big milestones related to either your extensions or you could even say in Postgres that you're looking forward to?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001054---bertrand">[00:10:54]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#001054---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001054---bertrand" title="Direct link to 001054---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. What I would like to see is improvement in observability and this kind of stuff. For example, there is wait event, but for the moment there is no really details around it. For example, if you have a buffer content wait event, I would like to know for which relation, for example. And so this is kind of stuff I would like to try to contribute myself and to improve. That's an area I am interested in.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001129---ry">[00:11:29]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001129---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001129---ry" title="Direct link to 001129---ry">​</a></h5><p>Is your goal to become a Postgres committer? Are you working towards that in your head?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001137---bertrand">[00:11:37]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#001137---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001137---bertrand" title="Direct link to 001137---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, my goal is first to be a contributor because for the moment that's not the case. And yeah. Trying to move step by step. Yes. And to improve my knowledge and improve the product if I can.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001152---ry">[00:11:52]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001152---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001152---ry" title="Direct link to 001152---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. I think our CTO at Tembo did an analysis recently and I think he saw it was like forget it was like seven and a half years average amount of contributor time before you get to be a committer in Postgres. I'd say it's as much time as going to school to become a doctor, maybe even longer. It's pretty high bar. I think it's great in some ways that Postgres is so selective.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001224---bertrand">[00:12:24]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#001224---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001224---bertrand" title="Direct link to 001224---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>So maybe I'm already too old to reach this goal.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001227---ry">[00:12:27]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001227---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001227---ry" title="Direct link to 001227---ry">​</a></h5><p>I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. Well that's good. I'm curious, kind of shifting away a little from Postgres, but as an engineer, what are some of the most important lessons you've learned over your career? I know this is kind of an open ended question, but does anything come to mind?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001248---bertrand">[00:12:48]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#001248---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001248---bertrand" title="Direct link to 001248---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. So listen to others, learn from others and accept remarks and different point of view. I think it's very important.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001259---ry">[00:12:59]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001259---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001259---ry" title="Direct link to 001259---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. What do you think about the way Postgres work is managed? Mailing list and diffs and I guess patches. Does it bother you at all or do you kind of find it a refreshing difference from the GitHub way?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001320---bertrand">[00:13:20]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#001320---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001320---bertrand" title="Direct link to 001320---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. So I am not that young. So working with email for me is perfectly fine and I think it works pretty well. I mean, the project I think is working well that way. But yes, I can imagine that maybe younger people would like to work differently than by email, but for my personal case, that's okay for me.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001347---ry">[00:13:47]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001347---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001347---ry" title="Direct link to 001347---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think the reason why I think it works so well is it's truly a global community. Right. Obviously if you have everybody in approximately the same time zone on a team, you can make decisions and have conversations outside of email. But I think the discussion first, it's almost like a demo first, design first sort of mentality versus Hey, A PR just popped in. Let's talk about that code. I don't know, I think it's refreshingly different. I think some other open source projects that want to be notable could adopt this methodology, even though on the surface it feels very frictionful. But I think it's intentionally that way. Let's talk about this before we do it, right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001438---bertrand">[00:14:38]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#001438---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001438---bertrand" title="Direct link to 001438---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's right.

A lot of other open source projects I think can't pull that off without being somehow a commercial endeavor.

I was like, I really want to contribute to something open source.

Yeah. Why not now? Okay. All right, so if you had a magic wand and you could add any feature magically to Postgres, what would you use that magic wand on?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001926---bertrand">[00:19:26]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#001926---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001926---bertrand" title="Direct link to 001926---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. So, observability to improve this area, I think now it's very rich in term of feature and development feature, but observability, I think it's really an area to improve my opinion.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001943---ry">[00:19:43]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001943---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001943---ry" title="Direct link to 001943---ry">​</a></h5><p>It's tricky with an open source project. Again, I'm sure AWS you guys do it a certain way too, but we get, I don't know how many 350 Prometheus metrics out of it right now? Would you argue that? How many more bits of information should we get? What's great observability? It seems like a lot, but I also think sometimes I'm looking for information that's just not there. So maybe a lot of low hanging fruit has been done, but not the hard stuff or. Yeah, I'm kind of curious what's missing in the observability that's available today.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002026---bertrand">[00:20:26]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#002026---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002026---bertrand" title="Direct link to 002026---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, so I think it's really, for example, wait event. I would like to have more details like depending on each wait event, for example, data file. Wait which file for example.

Especially the one coming from Oracle and they used to have a lot of observability that I think.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002114---ry">[00:21:14]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002114---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002114---ry" title="Direct link to 002114---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it's interesting. I'm trying to think the role of DBA. I think the more managed Postgres there is, the less DBAs there are per se in terms of having access to those low level details. But yet in Postgres a lot of people still self host and you probably expect like that'll never go away. Right.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002144---bertrand">[00:21:44]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#002144---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002144---bertrand" title="Direct link to 002144---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>But even in managed services for the moment, we can only provide what is available. If you look at performance insight, for example, you have the wait events, but at some time you need to guess what is really happening because there is a lack of details, I think.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002204---ry">[00:22:04]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002204---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002204---ry" title="Direct link to 002204---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. So you would make that available again in your magic one scenario you would add that information and you would make it available even to end users in RDS because it can help them understand how to optimize how they're using RDS.

So I can also know which Plow ID was used in the past, which one is used currently and maybe there is a bad plan that were used and that's why it were slow before this kind of area.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002301---ry">[00:23:01]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002301---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002301---ry" title="Direct link to 002301---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002302---bertrand">[00:23:02]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#002302---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002302---bertrand" title="Direct link to 002302---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Also able to export statistic and import statistic table statistic.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002309---ry">[00:23:09]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002309---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002309---ry" title="Direct link to 002309---ry">​</a></h5><p>Do you ever run a query and it's like I would say I'm more on the novice side. I mean, I can write some pretty nice queries with all kinds of features, but I really don't understand how files are interacting and so on. But sometimes I run a query and it's like, oh, this one's taking a long time. I wonder why obviously. Has it ever been thought like it'd be kind of cool to run that same query, but get a visual of what's going on inside? Are there services or have you seen anything like that where a novice user could visualize what's going on inside of a long running query kind of as it's happening? Or does it have to be like an analytical process to figure out why it's going to go slow?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002402---bertrand">[00:24:02]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#002402---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002402---bertrand" title="Direct link to 002402---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>I think so once you have the explain of the query, there is some tools like for example one that Dalibo provides which can graphically represent your execution.

Yeah. Again, one of the things we're trying to do with Tembo is just bring advanced Postgres things to novice users. As you know, most people using Postgres have gone 1% deep into the depths of what's there and it's pretty intimidating for new users, I think. In a good way. I think it's nice that it's deep and not shallow, but it's a lot. True. That's true. Yeah. I mean the same thing with like Linux, right? Or git. If you actually try to understand how git works, you'd be like oh man, is there anything about Postgres that almost nobody agrees with you? Do you have any contrarian opinions on anything? I know this is like me trying to get you to fight with the community, but I'm just curious. I love hearing contrarian views.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002538---bertrand">[00:25:38]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#002538---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002538---bertrand" title="Direct link to 002538---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>No, not that I can think about.

Does it belong inside of the core? I guess this could be a point.

But if there's 100 things like that, it bloats up. Postgres but yeah, maybe that.

Okay. But once again production issues. It's just a tricky thing to me because the open source project the is kind of like the inner core and things related to running it in production. Let's take for example like a Kubernetes operator. I think we could probably all agree, like a Kubernetes operator shouldn't be inside of the Postgres project per se, but that means a backup strategy can't be inside of the project either. Yeah, these edges are interesting. I think it's just like how much observability should be inside of versus outside of the core. Would you argue all of it should be inside? Like, would you say pgsentinel ought to be merged into core?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002815---bertrand">[00:28:15]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#002815---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002815---bertrand" title="Direct link to 002815---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>No, I don't think so.

Discoverability of extensions, that's one of the things we're working pretty hard on too, is trying to. I think it'd be great to have. We want to have metadata maybe at some point. We haven't really talked to the Amazon team about this, but I want to basically have a place where managed service providers can report which extensions are being used. So just so we can know what's popular, what goes well with something else, what pairs nicely. If I'm using five extensions, what's the 6th extension I ought to be using? Given that profile would be nice because I think digging into these extensions is a big opportunity for developers. Someone might be banging their head against the problem that pgsentinel solves. Developers might be. And I have, I've banged my head against that problem for hours, not days or anything like that. But I've thought about checked. Checked for the. Certainly there's got to be a history of active sessions somewhere in here, and it couldn't really find it or even a way to make it very easily. That was my thought. I was like, should be some way to create it. But anyway, curious. Do you listen to podcasts very much?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003000---bertrand">[00:30:00]<!-- --> - Bertrand<a href="#003000---bertrand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003000---bertrand" title="Direct link to 003000---bertrand">​</a></h5><p>Times to times, yes.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="An elephant representing pgvector" src="/assets/images/pgvector-9f580aff19c86daf18937e1ad7449194.jpeg" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_SS3x"></p><p align="right" style="color:grey"><em>Image credit: Generated with Bing Image Creator</em></p><p>In databases, indexes are data structures that speed up finding specific values in a table column. The analogous task in vector databases consists of finding the (approximate) nearest-neighbors of a given vector. So, to accomplish this task fast, we can similarly create specialized vector indexes. </p><p>But, speeding up a query is not just about blindly creating an index. When deciding whether to create one or more indexes on a table, several factors need to be considered—for example, the size of the tables, whether the table is modified frequently, how the table is used in queries, and so on. Similar considerations apply to vector indexes.</p><p>In today's post, let us explore vector indexes and their tradeoffs in the context of Postgres and <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pgvector</a>. In particular, let us compare their build time, size, and speed, and, based on that, derive some guidelines to decide which one to choose for a given application.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="indexes-in-pgvector">Indexes in Pgvector<a href="#indexes-in-pgvector" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Indexes in Pgvector" title="Direct link to Indexes in Pgvector">​</a></h2><p>Pgvector is an open-source Postgres extension for similarity search. It allows for exact and approximate nearest-neighbor search. In particular, for ANN it offers two types of indexes: IVFFlat and HNSW. Let us briefly discuss them.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="ivfflat">IVFFlat<a href="#ivfflat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to IVFFlat" title="Direct link to IVFFlat">​</a></h3><p>The IVFFlat (Inverted File with Flat Compression) index works by dividing the vectors in the table into multiple lists. The algorithm calculates a number of <strong>centroids</strong> and finds the <strong>clusters</strong> around those centroids. So, there is a list for each centroid, and the elements of these lists are the vectors that make up its corresponding cluster.</p><p>When searching for the K nearest vectors, instead of calculating the distance to all vectors, the search space is narrowed to only a subset of the lists, thus reducing the number of computations. Which lists are the candidates? The ones whose centroid is closer to the search vector.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IVFFlat" src="/assets/images/ivfflat-7a5fa9534a84ab9afb62da111122a1dc.png" width="674" height="442" class="img_SS3x"></p><p align="right" style="color:grey"><em>IVFFlat generates lists based on clusters.</em></p><p>So, we can infer that the effectiveness of the index depends on two parameters: the number/size of the lists and the number of lists that need to be examined during the search (aka probes).</p><p>In pgvector, these two parameters are selected in two distinct moments. First, the number of lists is chosen when creating the index, for example:</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_D5yF"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sql codeBlock_RMoD thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_AclH"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">CREATE</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">INDEX</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">ON</span><span class="token plain"> items </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">USING</span><span class="token plain"> ivfflat </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token plain">embedding vector_cosine_ops</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">WITH</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token plain">lists </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token number" style="color:#36acaa">1000</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_aaMX"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_z5j7" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_FoOz"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_L0B6"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Second, the number of lists to be explored is established during execution, e.g.:</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_D5yF"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sql codeBlock_RMoD thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_AclH"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">SET</span><span class="token plain"> ivfflat</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">.</span><span class="token plain">probes </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token number" style="color:#36acaa">32</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_aaMX"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_z5j7" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_FoOz"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_L0B6"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>The <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#ivfflat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pgvector documentation</a> suggests the following:</p><blockquote><p>Choose an appropriate number of lists - a good place to start is rows / 1000 for up to 1M rows and sqrt(rows) for over 1M rows</p><p>When querying, specify an appropriate number of probes (higher is better for recall, lower is better for speed) - a good place to start is sqrt(lists)</p></blockquote><p>So, imagine that we have a dataset of 1M vectors. With the parameters above, pgvector would generate 1,000 lists of <em>approximately</em> 1,000 vectors. When executing a query, it would only query ~32 of such lists and execute ~32,000 comparisons to find the closest neighbors to a search vector. That is, only 0.032X compared to a full scan.</p><p>Of course, you can choose different parameters to achieve the desired recall.

What do we mean by that?</p><p>Well, <code>Recall</code> measures how many retrieved neighbors are indeed in the true kNN group. For example, a recall of 1.0 means that all calculated neighbors are really the closest. Whereas a recall of 0.5 means that only half of the computed neighbors are the closest. Recall is an important metric because it helps measure the approximation errors and tune the index parameters.</p><p>IVFFlat and HNSW are approximate indexes that work with heuristics. That means that there could be errors in their search results.</p><p>Take IVFFlat as an example. When deciding which lists to scan, the decision is taken based on the distance to the centroid of the list. Depending on the data and the tuning parameters, the closest vector to the search vector could correspond to a list that was not selected for probing, thus reducing the accuracy of the result.</p><p>One way to mitigate this problem and boost recall is to increase the number of lists to probe. But that, of course, would incur a performance penalty. So, <strong>improving the recall is not for free</strong>, and careful evaluation and tuning of the parameters is paramount. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="ivfflat-vs-hnsw-in-the-pgvector-arena">IVFFlat vs HNSW in the pgvector arena<a href="#ivfflat-vs-hnsw-in-the-pgvector-arena" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to IVFFlat vs HNSW in the pgvector arena" title="Direct link to IVFFlat vs HNSW in the pgvector arena">​</a></h2><p>Now, let us examine the two types of indexes quantitatively. We will use the <a href="https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ANN benchmark</a>, which we modified to have <a href="https://github.com/binidxaba/ann-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both algorithms available</a>.</p><p>For pgvector, the benchmark creates a table with a vector column, taking the chosen dataset and inserting the items into the table. Then, it builds the selected type of index, and after that, it executes a bunch of queries. The dataset contains both train and test data. The benchmarking program uses the test data to evaluate the recall for each algorithm.</p><p>For this comparison, let us use a <a href="https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks/#data-sets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small dataset</a> of around 1M vectors of 50 dimensions. The test set consists of 10K queries, and we want to obtain the 10 nearest neighbors.</p><p>The aspects that we want to evaluate are:</p><ul><li>Build Time</li><li>Size</li><li>Recall</li><li>Speed</li></ul><p>For these experiments, let us ask ourselves: How are the different parameters affected if I want a recall of X? In particular, let us set a recall of 0.998.</p><p>In pgvector, such recall is achieved with the following settings:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Index type</th><th>Parameters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>IVFFlat</strong></td><td>Lists = 200, Probes = 100</td></tr><tr><td><strong>HNSW</strong></td><td>m = 24, ef_construction = 200, ef_search = 800</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="build-time">Build Time<a href="#build-time" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Build Time" title="Direct link to Build Time">​</a></h3><p>For the chosen parameters, IVFFlat indexes can be created quicker (128 seconds) compared to HNSW (4065 seconds). HNSW creation is almost 32X slower.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Build time" src="/assets/images/001_build_time-804e1afdba1d865b66aa8c0064701d76.png" width="600" height="371" class="img_SS3x"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="size">Size<a href="#size" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Size" title="Direct link to Size">​</a></h3><p>In terms of index size, IVFFlat is again the winner.

The reason for that is that the centroids are not recalculated. So, the different regions in the vector space remain the same if vectors are added or removed.

I'm Rye Walker, founder of Tembo, a managed Postgres company, and today I have Phil Noel from ParadeDB, working on ParadeDB as my guest. Phil, welcome to the show.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000037---phil">[00:00:37]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000037---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000037---phil" title="Direct link to 000037---phil">​</a></h5><p>Thanks. Yeah, thanks. Nice to meet you. Thanks for having me.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000042---ry">[00:00:42]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000042---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000042---ry" title="Direct link to 000042---ry">​</a></h5><p>Great to actually meet you. I'd like to start...maybe you could give us a quick background, like maybe where'd you grow up in the world? And what were you doing before?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000053---phil">[00:00:53]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000053---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000053---phil" title="Direct link to 000053---phil">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, absolutely. Happy to. So I'm originally from Quebec City, the French part of Canada. I actually grew up in this small town called <!-- -->[inaudible 01:02]<!-- --> , which is 2 hours East. Spent most of my life there, and then eventually I left to go to university. I stayed in Boston, studied computer science and neuroscience, did a few things. I started a browser company before ParadeDB, which I ran for about three years, and then after that got acquaintance with the joys of Postgres, you could say through that experience. Sounds somewhat similar to yours, maybe, although not to the same scale. And my previous co founder and I only started ParadeDB.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000135---ry">[00:01:35]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000135---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000135---ry" title="Direct link to 000135---ry">​</a></h5><p>Nice. Tell the browser company, what was that called and how far did you get in that project?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000143---phil">[00:01:43]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000143---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000143---phil" title="Direct link to 000143---phil">​</a></h5><p>Oh, that is both a short and a long story. It was called Wisp. We were building like a cloud based web browser, so the initial idea was to offload heavy processing to the cloud by streaming, which is like an age old idea, but we were young and dumb, so we thought we had invented something. We did that for a while, raised a couple of rounds of funding, grew a team to like 25 people, but we never quite found PMF and eventually pivoted to cybersecurity. Did that for a while, but it was a much better market, but not our battle to win. So we closed down the company. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000221---ry">[00:02:21]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000221---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000221---ry" title="Direct link to 000221---ry">​</a></h5><p>Okay. I'm sure we both have a lot of battle stories we could commiserate over. Do you remember when you first started using Postgres? I can't remember. That's why I ask this question, because it kind of just happened at some point in my career. But do you remember specifically when you started with Postgres?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000245---phil">[00:02:45]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000245---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000245---phil" title="Direct link to 000245---phil">​</a></h5><p>I don't know. Actually. That's a good question. I don't know. As a user? I don't know. As a developer since earlier this year or last year.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000258---ry">[00:02:58]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000258---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000258---ry" title="Direct link to 000258---ry">​</a></h5><p>Well, cool. Obviously as a user, you've used it for years, I'm sure. Tell me about your Postgres work. What have you built in the past and what are you building now? Or is this all just the first thing?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000312---phil">[00:03:12]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000312---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000312---phil" title="Direct link to 000312---phil">​</a></h5><p>I guess I would say it's the first major thing. So we can keep it to that, what we're doing. So we're building ParadeDB. ParadeDB is like a Postgres database, essentially, or Postgres extension, where we're integrating native full text search within Postgres, which is something that some people are quick to jump to say this already exists, and some people are quick to jump to say the one that exists is very bad. And so they're excited about what we're doing. So it depends which camp you fall on. But the first thing we released is this extension is called pg_bm25, where we're essentially integrating proper full text search within Postgres and then combine this with some of the existing innovations that's come, like pgvector to build hybrid search. And our goal is to build this Postgres type database that is sort of the go to choice for companies where search is critical to the product they're building. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000408---ry">[00:04:08]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000408---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000408---ry" title="Direct link to 000408---ry">​</a></h5><p>Nice. Why do you think you're working on this? What led you here?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000414---phil">[00:04:14]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000414---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000414---phil" title="Direct link to 000414---phil">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's a good question, actually. This is a problem we face ourselves and that's kind of why we wanted to solve it. So after my first company, my co founder and I, we were trying to decide what we're going to do next. So we started doing some contracting work sort of left and right. I was living in Paris at the time and working with a lot of French and German company. And when we were working with this German automaker, they just really needed high quality full text search within Postgres. So the promo we were building for them, and instead we had to glue Elasticsearch or some vector database on top. And it was just a nightmare. And we were very frustrated how bad it was and decided, you know what, maybe we should just fix it ourselves. And so that kind of led us to today. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000500---ry">[00:05:00]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000500---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000500---ry" title="Direct link to 000500---ry">​</a></h5><p>Got it. Yeah, it's interesting. I don't know. There was a famous tweet that I can't remember the exact wording on, but it basically said something to the effect that, hey, tech founders, you do yourself well to pivot to building something that would support whatever you would be building today. Basically go one level deeper than your current idea is similar to what we did at Astronomer, because we were basically building a competitor to segment clickstream data processing. And then we started using Airflow. Then we said, hey, let's just provide airflow as a service. And kind of made that switch to go down a level and that was the winning pivot for that company. So it sounds like you've kind of jumped down to more of an infrastructural issue, which I think is good. Well, what challenges? Obviously there's a lot of ground to cover, but what are your biggest challenges, would you say you face so far? Building this thing.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000612---phil">[00:06:12]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000612---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000612---phil" title="Direct link to 000612---phil">​</a></h5><p>You mean like business wise or technical wise or process wise?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000616---ry">[00:06:16]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000616---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000616---ry" title="Direct link to 000616---ry">​</a></h5><p>Actually, yeah. I'd love to hear all categories of challenge. Yeah, spill the beans. What's hard about this? I imagine fundraise. I mean, it's a tough time to fundraise, so that's probably not awesome. But yeah, maybe start technically.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000633---phil">[00:06:33]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000633---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000633---phil" title="Direct link to 000633---phil">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I can start technically. I think software is the easiest part of building a company, so I would say these are our simplest set of challenges. Not to say it's know, I was actually talking to Eric that I listened to the Hacking Postgres episode with Eric and I talked to him afterwards. At first we didn't know pgrx was a thing, and we were like, oh my God, how on earth is this even going to be a thing? And then we found out pgrx was a thing and we're like, wow, it went from near impossible to quite doable, really. So, like on the technical front, I mean, there's just so much you need to do when you're building search, right? We have covered a small ground of features of what people expect, and there are so many more that we need to build, and so we're trying to prioritize that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000725---ry">[00:07:25]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000725---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000725---ry" title="Direct link to 000725---ry">​</a></h5><p>Obviously Elastic is probably the big competitor. Can you estimate what percentage of their functionality you aim to replace? Is it essentially 100% and what's your progress towards that?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000741---phil">[00:07:41]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000741---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000741---phil" title="Direct link to 000741---phil">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's a good question. I mean, our progress was small. It's small enough that you can use it, but Elastic is enormous, right? I don't think we aim to replace or not to replace, sorry. To match 100% of their features, at least for transactional data, which is what we need today. I think we actually had a decent bit of the way done and definitely enough to keep us busy for a couple of months. But I think that's sort of the first step of what we're looking to match beyond that, like what everything elastic does for observability, that's sort of another story, and that's another milestone that we will see depending on what our customers want.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000829---ry">[00:08:29]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000829---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000829---ry" title="Direct link to 000829---ry">​</a></h5><p>Obviously I'm building a fresh new tech startup as well, and I understand you got to match the functionality of, I call it the table stakes features. But then you also have to come up with some differentiators or else no one will care. So what are the biggest differentiators you're thinking about with ParadeDB?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000849---phil">[00:08:49]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#000849---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000849---phil" title="Direct link to 000849---phil">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, so that's a good question. I think for ParadeDB right now, the differentiator has been, ironically, I would say the combination of two non differentiated things, if that makes sense, which is like, if you want to do search over transactional data, ParadeDB is sort of the best solution today because it's the only thing that actually truly combines the two. It wasn't done before. And so sort of our initial interest, I would say, has come from that. So typically when people wanted to do this, they would have some managed Postgres provider, of which there are many, and then they would use Elastic and then they would need to combine the two and then run the two and so on. It can be a ton of work. And so ParadeDB sort of makes that a single system and especially for small companies, which is where you've been really, it's been a lot easier to manage, I would say. And so that really draws them to us. That's sort of like our initial point initially, but we have some other things that will be coming up which hopefully will expand on this sort of initial interest.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000952---ry">[00:09:52]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#000952---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000952---ry" title="Direct link to 000952---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it seemed to me like as I think about building my next search bar in a product, I have to decide do I want to go what I can so call like the old school way versus vector search? Maybe I can get away with some sort of AI integration for search. Are people asking that question or do they have the perception that maybe like vector search somehow gets, replaces or displaces in some way traditional full text search type features?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001028---phil">[00:10:28]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001028---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001028---phil" title="Direct link to 001028---phil">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's a very good question. A lot of people have, I've talked to a lot of people who weigh in on both sides of the coin. I would say my personal take is both will remain quite important just because at the end of the day people will still have data and we'll still need to be able to find instances of those data. Right. And there's one way to find it via similarity, but there's also sometimes you just want to start from a clean place. And so I think both are quite valuable. Most of the people we talk to, hybrid search is very important to them, like the combination of the two, both big and small companies. And that's one of the reasons why we built Parade the way we did today, where pgvector exists and so many others. And I would almost say vector search is kind of table stake now. We don't really have to innovate on that so much ourselves, I would say. But the traditional search is kind of the piece that's been missing, which is why we released this first extension, pg_bm25, and then we offered the combination of both as well <!-- -->[inaudible 11:29]<!-- -->  with another extension called pg_search, which we're going to be publicizing more heavily soon.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001135---ry">[00:11:35]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001135---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001135---ry" title="Direct link to 001135---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think it seems like, well, it seems to me like everything has to have an AI story or else perhaps it's been outdated. Right. So I think even search, even full tech search, you can say I like that the hybrid answer is a good answer. Obviously then you have to figure out how to hybridize it all. And that's not necessarily trivial. But yeah, I'm curious to see what you come up with on this.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001207---phil">[00:12:07]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001207---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001207---phil" title="Direct link to 001207---phil">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it takes some effort. It takes some effort. I would say we definitely have an AI story, but our personal take on the whole AI world and fade is like AI is sort of a step function improvement on existing things being done, but you need a foundation of value proposition for customers on the fundamental non AI part of the product, if that makes sense. And that's kind of how we think about it. There are so many people that are trying to bring AI when there was nothing useful to begin with. Well, I really think of AI as taking something that was useful to begin with and making it that much better. And so it kind of plays quite well actually with the way we've been going about delivering this product and saying like, hey, we'll just give you really good full text search and obviously so much more can be done. But if that is not useful in the first place in Postgres, then who cares that I can add AI to.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001301---ry">[00:13:01]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001301---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001301---ry" title="Direct link to 001301---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, yeah, I agree. Yeah, I think about it. Know you can't build AI without training data, right? And you can't, you can't have training data without a product. You know, to collect some base level data. If you have a base level of product without AI, basically you have to start without AI, don't have data at all. And I think that's a challenge. A lot of founders, maybe they're thinking they're going to go straight to AI. They're like, there's nothing. You got to start basic. Yeah, I agree. What are some big milestones? How many big milestones do you have envisioned for ParadeDB at this moment?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001344---phil">[00:13:44]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001344---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001344---phil" title="Direct link to 001344---phil">​</a></h5><p>That's also a good question.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001346---ry">[00:13:46]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001346---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001346---ry" title="Direct link to 001346---ry">​</a></h5><p>I mean you probably have a next one, right? You usually know your next big milestone.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001350---phil">[00:13:50]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001350---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001350---phil" title="Direct link to 001350---phil">​</a></h5><p>Hopefully you'd have that. Yeah, of course.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001353---ry">[00:13:53]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001353---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001353---ry" title="Direct link to 001353---ry">​</a></h5><p>And you also tell me what it is. But I'm curious.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001358---phil">[00:13:58]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001358---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001358---phil" title="Direct link to 001358---phil">​</a></h5><p>Happy to share. I mean, to be honest our big milestones was to get a thousand stars in new Hub and then some stranger posted our repo on Hacker News and somehow that happened in a couple of days, which was really exciting and rather unexpected. Now our big milestone is we're about to release our own small version of managed Postgres ish specifically for ParadeDB to test how else we can deliver value to people. Like many that have been using the product so far have been using our self hosted version, which I'm sure you're extremely familiar with how people don't want to do this, doing Tembo. So that's the next big milestone that's coming, trying to learn to manage this. And then after that we have a couple of, I think after that we'll see the exact number. We're just trying to get more people on it and see what they think. Really.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001453---ry">[00:14:53]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001453---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001453---ry" title="Direct link to 001453---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, just grow users. This is another thing I've been thinking about around just even like we have stacks at Tembo with different use cases for Postgres, and then some things ought to be workloads separated from other things. Like for example, do you keep your analytical workload separate from transactional? That's clear. But search is interesting, whether that's like an add on. Is that just work that the transactional database should be doing, or is it somehow, do you think the workload for search should be isolated from traditional transactional workloads? From an application standpoint, that's a good question.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001536---phil">[00:15:36]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001536---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001536---phil" title="Direct link to 001536---phil">​</a></h5><p>I think it depends what product you're building, to be honest, because you don't want to slow down transactions. That's something that's very important to us. For example, I think it's possible to integrate it, actually. I think it's up to you, the way we're thinking about it. So the way we've built ParadeDB is we offer weak consistency over search. So what this means is the way we build searches, we have inverted indices that store the tokenized data that you want to search over, but those are weakly consistent. So just like if you use Elastic, for example, and something like Zombodb, and then you synchronize it, there will be some lag between transactions being updated in your database and eventually being reflected in your search engine, the same thing happens, but it happens automatically for ParadB, instead of being it can be minutes sometimes here will be like a few seconds at the very most, but it ensures that your transactions are never slowed down, which is quite critical for people. So I think if you build in that way, it's actually quite possible to centralize it and have it be integrated with the actual database. If you don't use a product where search is built that way, then I don't think you want to slow down your transaction so you have to isolate them.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001648---ry">[00:16:48]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001648---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001648---ry" title="Direct link to 001648---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think a lot of people just obviously just do it inside their transactional database because it seems like overkill. Spin up a new Postgres, just especially like traditional shitty full tech search that's available. But if we want to get good search, if I wanted to build really good search into an application, I would go buy Algolia or something like that. And that clearly is a microservice at that point, right? I'm sending data to them to index and they're sending me back results really quickly that are happening. It's not taxing my main database as a part of that. So I kind of like thinking of search as, let's call it great search as a microservice candidate for sure, because the better you make it, the more compute it requires. The more compute it requires, the more it's competing. Right? So I don't know, I like the idea of just taking that worldview. That great search needs to be separated from the transactional or analytical.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001803---phil">[00:18:03]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001803---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001803---phil" title="Direct link to 001803---phil">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think you're right in a lot of ways. You do need to be able to orchestrate it properly at scale. This is definitely something that we will ponder more and more as we have more people using it and using it at greater scale. I do think even if it needs to be solely separate from what we have done today, one of the great things and where DBMS and Postgres managed companies like ParadeDB or Tembo show up is in the ability to just make it transparent to the customer. The actual complexity of the orchestration behind the.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001837---ry">[00:18:37]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#001837---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001837---ry" title="Direct link to 001837---ry">​</a></h5><p>So, you know, you've been writing code for a number of years now. What would you say your most important lesson has been? Kind of switching from the technical to the interpersonal or just like professional. Do you have any top lesson? If you're going to meet with a young developer, you'd say.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001900---phil">[00:19:00]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#001900---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001900---phil" title="Direct link to 001900---phil">​</a></h5><p>Specifically on writing code? Yeah, specifically on writing code. I would say only write the code that you need to write. I think that's like a big one. Our previous company, maybe I'll bother with this one. I like to think of products and startups now as like science experiments, as works of art. And I think our previous company, we thought of it as a work of art. So we came out of college, we were so incredibly into it and we wanted to be perfect. We cared so tremendously about what we did, that we always went above and beyond and it always made the product better and it involved writing more code, but it did not always make the product better in a way that meaningfully improved the experience of the user or brought us closer to product market fit. Right. And so I think if you think of a work of art like it's never finished, it needs to be perfect, versus a science experiment is more like, what's the bare minimum I can do to validate or invalidate this hypothesis I have or deliver value to a customer. And so what I would say, what I wish I could say to my younger self was, if no one has asked for this, I don't think you need to do it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002012---ry">[00:20:12]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002012---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002012---ry" title="Direct link to 002012---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it's a good point. So you're saying be more of a scientist than an artist, perhaps to some degree. When you're starting on something and it's not validated.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002026---phil">[00:20:26]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002026---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002026---phil" title="Direct link to 002026---phil">​</a></h5><p>I think a lot of great products are almost like work of arts. Like, people were so obsessed over it and you can feel that. And so I don't think you want to leave all types of esthetic approach or care to it, but I think definitely early on, before you even sink so much time into it, you just want to get feedback quickly. Right. And that involves just only writing the code you need to write. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002049---ry">[00:20:49]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002049---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002049---ry" title="Direct link to 002049---ry">​</a></h5><p>I'll tell you a quick story. Like when we started astronomer, I have a good friend, Greg Neiheisel. He was CTO and basically my partner of crime. And we just very much mind melded on a lot of things. But our attitude following your principle was really what we were building was this beautiful lattice of glue, and everything was open source inside. So we used, for example, we used Google's material design, which had just come out, and we built a UI, like, adhering to it perfectly, and ended up being a beautiful UI because guess what? Those guys built a great framework and we had no designer on the team. Google was our designer. We would joke about it all the time, and we actually chose a color scheme for the company that was kind of Googley, had the same four main colors. So it was really easy to build something great. But that we really built the first version of our product was entirely open source components just glued together in a unique way. And that was our art. It was like this inner skeleton of orchestration, or just like I said, I can think of it like a lattice of glue that's holding all these things together. And, yeah, it was a very successful product. And it looks basically how you arrange open source components is art. It's a creative endeavor, I think, and it's enough for a brand new product. It's enough art. You don't have to go and reinvent, like, for example, the airflow UI during this really hard early project. And you don't have to go reinvent the Postgres UI. Maybe you want to, but you're like, let's handle the first things first. So did you think of a lesson that was non technical that you learned that you would tell your younger self or not really?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002249---phil">[00:22:49]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002249---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002249---phil" title="Direct link to 002249---phil">​</a></h5><p>Oh, I have so many. I spent a lot of time thinking after our previous companies didn't work out specifically. I don't know. This is a broad question. I can go in every direction. Let me think, which one is the best one to share? Yeah, I would say, okay. One interesting lesson is I'll focus on the youth as well. And what you mentioned. When we were building our first company, our first product, we felt very righteous. We were doing something very difficult and objectively, technically difficult. And a lot of people have tried before, and we were like, they must have done it wrong. Who are they? People with more experience and context than us to know how to do this really well. And so we always started every premise of what we were doing from the premise that we were correct. Right. And then we were strived to further validate the fact that we were correct. And I think this leads to a lot of cognitive dissonance when you turn out to be wrong. Right. Because you had this idea of what you were thinking, and it's now being challenged versus now the way we think about it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002407---phil">[00:24:07]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002407---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002407---phil" title="Direct link to 002407---phil">​</a></h5><p>And I mean this from a personal standpoint, from the way we talk and hire people, from the way we talk to customers, from the way we try to build product now, we just think we're wrong. I always assume I'm wrong in what I think, and then I strive to prove myself correct. Right. And if we do manage to prove ourselves to be correct, then it's like a very positive moment. You're like, that's amazing. I found this great surprise that I wasn't fully convinced of before. And if you turn out to be wrong, you're like, well, kind of thought I could be wrong all along, not a big deal, and then sort of drop this and move to something else. And I think it's a mental framework that has served us a lot better in everything that we do now.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002445---ry">[00:24:45]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002445---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002445---ry" title="Direct link to 002445---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I love that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002447---phil">[00:24:47]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002447---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002447---phil" title="Direct link to 002447---phil">​</a></h5><p>Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002448---ry">[00:24:48]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002448---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002448---ry" title="Direct link to 002448---ry">​</a></h5><p>I think it's a tricky catch 22. Like, you have to, as a founder, live in a reality distortion field just to change the world. You have to have a crazy idea that most people disagree with. Those are the best ideas. Unfortunately, they're also the worst ideas.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002505---phil">[00:25:05]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002505---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002505---phil" title="Direct link to 002505---phil">​</a></h5><p>Exactly.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002506---ry">[00:25:06]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002506---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002506---ry" title="Direct link to 002506---ry">​</a></h5><p>Just accept that, hey, you might be. At the same time, you have to also fight for your idea. Even if you hear negative, it's like, oh, man, I built all this infrastructure for it to be righteous, and now it's hard to give up on it. I think it's wrong to give up on it a lot of times, because, again, I think that some of the best ideas almost everyone would disagree with as it starts. I agree. It's a much better mindset to understand that it's a lottery ticket sort of odds not, hey, well, if you were a good student, you know you can get an A in a class, right? You know you can get an A. It's just a matter of doing the right amount of work, and you'll get an A. But it doesn't work that way with startups. Exactly.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002559---phil">[00:25:59]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002559---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002559---phil" title="Direct link to 002559---phil">​</a></h5><p>Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002600---ry">[00:26:00]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002600---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002600---ry" title="Direct link to 002600---ry">​</a></h5><p>Cool. So, well, I'm curious, like, are you paying attention to the Postgres ecosystem and other developments maybe that you're excited about that you've seen since you started working on.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002613---phil">[00:26:13]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002613---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002613---phil" title="Direct link to 002613---phil">​</a></h5><p>Have. I mean, there's, there's just so much that's happening in Postgres, obviously pretty excited about Tembo. I've been following you guys' journey. Just like, recently, there are people that I forget the name of the developer. That's very embarrassing. But someone released PG branching, which maybe you've seen, which is like, so I was talking to Nikita, the CEO of Neon, right? And he was, like, raving about their branching system, which I'm sure is world class and amazing. But it turns out other people might be able to do this someday, which is good for the community, perhaps. So I think that's quite an exciting extension that hasn't been made by us, for example, that we're very excited about. And there's many others that I could list.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002656---ry">[00:26:56]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002656---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002656---ry" title="Direct link to 002656---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it's interesting. My first reaction I saw, like, AWS announce, oh, we have active, active replication available on RDS. It's a new extension, you know. And I responded on Twitter, is it going to be open source? And crickets. So it makes me feel like time to. We'll study that extension, and the community needs to just build the open source version of it if they won't do it. I'm not salty about how the big clouds operate. Extracting value from open source. Because I'm extracting value from open source, and you are, too. We all are. All the way down. Like I said, it's like value extraction all the way down to Linux, but they could be. Obviously their goal is to build a proprietary alternatives and I really wish there was a Postgres company out there that was big and was worrying about the whole open source ecosystem. That's what we're trying to do. Yeah, there's so much going on. I don't know if it's because I'm looking at it now or if things have changed in 2023 versus 2022. It's great that it's happening too during what I would consider like a law in the venture ecosystem as well. So I think the stuff that's happening now will be strong. They always say like the startups that start during the slow parts of venture usually end up being more successful than the ones at the hype cycle. So you and I are both lucky we're starting here. Even those. It might not feel that way sometimes.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002839---phil">[00:28:39]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002839---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002839---phil" title="Direct link to 002839---phil">​</a></h5><p>I think it does feel that way though. We raised our seed round, things went quite well. It was a challenging raise, but challenging because people were very critical about what we're doing and I think that's good, right? Like the first company, we raised money on a terrible idea and we thought raising money was the good part. But actually if you have a terrible idea and people convince you of that early on, they're actually doing you a favor, right? Yeah, I think it's good. I'm very bullish on the companies that are going to be founded, that have been founded this year, that will be found next year and so on, because I think you're right. Overall, typically they turn out to be quite good. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002922---ry">[00:29:22]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#002922---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002922---ry" title="Direct link to 002922---ry">​</a></h5><p>So do you have a couple of favorite people that you've met in Postgres Land? Give them a shout out if you do.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002929---phil">[00:29:29]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#002929---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002929---phil" title="Direct link to 002929---phil">​</a></h5><p>Yes, sure. I mean I met Eric, which I think will take the prize for my favorite. He. He's very humble about it. He keeps saying TCDI needed pgrx. I think they really did it beyond what was needed for the benefit of the community. So I think he's definitely gone above and beyond and he continues to go above and beyond. Another one maybe you know him or not. He's the writer of one of the PG internals book called Hironobu, who's this Japanese man who lives in Europe now I haven't engaged with him very much, but he's made this resource called I think InterDB.jp or something like that. I could send you the link if you're curious, which goes into Postgres internals at a great detail. And it's been like a good resource for us in it. So shout out to that guy.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003023---ry">[00:30:23]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003023---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003023---ry" title="Direct link to 003023---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I definitely read the website, but I haven't spoken to the man.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003029---phil">[00:30:29]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#003029---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003029---phil" title="Direct link to 003029---phil">​</a></h5><p>Maybe we should try to email him a few times. Yeah, I tried to convince him to join us, but it was too difficult to sell.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003037---ry">[00:30:37]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003037---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003037---ry" title="Direct link to 003037---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, maybe he, I mean, I tried to convince Eric Ridge to join Tembo in the early on and he was too hard to sell.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003043---phil">[00:30:43]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#003043---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003043---phil" title="Direct link to 003043---phil">​</a></h5><p>I'm sure you did. Of course, I would have loved to convince, um, the naive part of me was like, I can't wait to convince Eric to join Parade. And then I talked to him, realized he basically is the co founder and CTO of TCDI. And I was like, okay, this isn't happening.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003101---ry">[00:31:01]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003101---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003101---ry" title="Direct link to 003101---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I was probably the 25th person to go after him. And you were probably the 27th person to go after him. Whatever.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003110---phil">[00:31:10]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#003110---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003110---phil" title="Direct link to 003110---phil">​</a></h5><p>Exactly.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003111---ry">[00:31:11]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003111---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003111---ry" title="Direct link to 003111---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think it's great. I'm kind of excited that these people, I'll call them like the gods of Postgres, are kind of locked up up on Mount Olympus. We don't get to see them or talk to them very much. That's exciting to me, to know that someday we'll get there. Someday, if our companies are strong enough, maybe we can get to work with those people. But it's great to be in an ecosystem where there is a tier of people that are just amazing. I was talking to Samay, who's the CTO here at Tembo, and he did the quick analysis. To see that most people become a committer at Postgres takes like around seven or eight years of contributing to Postgres before you get the commit bit, which is like, wow, that is an amazing. You think of venture backed startups, it's like two startups worth of effort sticking around for your full vesting before you get to be up. So it has nothing to do with the company that you're working for, it's just you're going to dedicate yourself to an open source project for the core of your professional life. Because once you get there, you probably want to stick around for another eight years, I'm sure.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003227---ry">[00:32:27]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003227---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003227---ry" title="Direct link to 003227---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it's pretty cool.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003228---phil">[00:32:28]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#003228---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003228---phil" title="Direct link to 003228---phil">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. But these people are great, and I think that's one of the things that's so great about Postgres community. Even though Eric and so on, they're amazing people and they're doing great things and they're very busy and so on. This are quite accessible, really. Eric is very accessible in the pgrx discord and so on. So I do feel like by building open source, we still get to work with them, even though not in the same organization. And some other people I forgot to shout out, which perhaps deserve a lot of shout out, is maybe like Umur and Ozgun from Citus, right? They were like truly visionaries of the Postgres world, building extensions when Postgres was a toy database, as people would like, critic being critical of.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003317---ry">[00:33:17]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003317---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003317---ry" title="Direct link to 003317---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, yeah, we're definitely standing on their shoulders. They've, they did a lot of hard work early on and yeah, it's great. If you had a magic wand, you could add any feature to Postgres tomorrow and it existed. Is there anything that you would use that wand on? Do you have any things you wish Postgres was that it isn't?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003340---phil">[00:33:40]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#003340---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003340---phil" title="Direct link to 003340---phil">​</a></h5><p>That's very interesting. I think the answer would be better distributed support. Actually, what Citus has done is amazing. But the whole reason Yugabyte exists today, for example, is because there's only so much you can do when you're an extension like Citus did, right? And like Yugabyte is basically trying to be the Postgres equivalent of CockroachDB. And I think if that was baked in natively to Postgres, it would be good for a lot of people that are building on Postgres included.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003413---ry">[00:34:13]<!-- --> - Ry<a href="#003413---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003413---ry" title="Direct link to 003413---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's a good one. Do you listen to podcasts very much?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003419---phil">[00:34:19]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#003419---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003419---phil" title="Direct link to 003419---phil">​</a></h5><p>Not very much, not very much.

No, I listen to PostgresFM all the time. I'm huge fans of those guys. I do listen to a lot of podcasts. But yeah. Just going to ask you what your favorites are. But you already said. All right, well cool. It was great talking to you. Where can listeners find you online? Maybe just tell us about yourself and then ParadeDB url and so on.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003449---phil">[00:34:49]<!-- --> - Phil<a href="#003449---phil" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003449---phil" title="Direct link to 003449---phil">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, so you can find us on paradedb.com or on a GitHub is ParadeDB as well. It's open source. We welcome contributions and users and so on. Of course we're very responsive. As for me specifically, I think you're going to link my Twitter in the bio, but my Twitter is PhilippeMNoel. It's basically my handle across every social media. I feel like when you can find one, you sort of keep it. There's so many people now on the internet, so that's my handle everywhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[image]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div style="width:75%"><p><img loading="lazy" alt="image" src="/assets/images/tembo-queue-805449fd409081b900fb16cefd7e52e5.png" width="822" height="753" class="img_SS3x"></p></div><p>Your app needs a message queue. Simple enough—until you try to do it, anyway.</p><p>Go set it up on Kafka? Sure...but now you have a Kafka cluster to manage.
Redis could work, but now you're just managing Redis instances instead.
SQS? That means you have to reconfigure your application to talk to AWS, and you also get an extra external bill as icing on the cake.
Let's build it on Postgres! However, if you follow most blogs and guides, you'll probably end up building an agent, watcher process, or background worker to make sure the queue stays healthy. It's better, but if the background worker fails, you could end up with bigger problems.</p><p>Fortunately, there's a better way.</p><p>By designing with a visibility timeout, we remove the need for external processes for queue management. PGMQ is a Postgres extension built following exactly this sort of self-regulating queue. Today we're going to combine PGMQ with pair of core Postgres features—FOR UPDATE and SKIP LOCKED—to cover all the needs of our message queue. FOR UPDATE helps ensure that just a single consumer receives a message in the queue. And SKIP LOCKED is required if you want to have multiple consumers on the same queue – without it each consumer would wait for the others to remove their locks. Before we put all the pieces together, let's do a quick refresher on how each of these works.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="for-update-ensuring-exclusive-access">FOR UPDATE: Ensuring Exclusive Access<a href="#for-update-ensuring-exclusive-access" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to FOR UPDATE: Ensuring Exclusive Access" title="Direct link to FOR UPDATE: Ensuring Exclusive Access">​</a></h2><p>Imagine a crowded store with a single cashier. As customers approach the counter, the cashier must serve them one at a time, ensuring each transaction is complete before moving on to the next. Similarly, when working with a queue, it's essential to ensure that only one process or transaction works with a particular row of data at a time. This is where FOR UPDATE comes into play.</p><p>The FOR UPDATE clause is used to lock selected rows, preventing other transactions from modifying or locking them until the current transaction ends. This ensures that once a task (or row in our queue) is picked up, it isn't grabbed by another worker or process simultaneously. It guarantees exclusive access, much like how our lone cashier attends to a single customer at a time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="skip-locked-keeping-the-line-moving">SKIP LOCKED: Keeping the Line Moving<a href="#skip-locked-keeping-the-line-moving" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to SKIP LOCKED: Keeping the Line Moving" title="Direct link to SKIP LOCKED: Keeping the Line Moving">​</a></h2><p>Back to our store analogy, if a customer isn't ready to check out and holds up the line, it can cause unnecessary delays for the other customers. What if, instead, those who aren't ready simply step aside, allowing others to continue? That would undoubtedly speed up the checkout process. This is the concept behind SKIP LOCKED.</p><p>When combined with FOR UPDATE, the SKIP LOCKED clause ensures that if a row is locked by another transaction, it gets skipped over, and the next available row is selected. This way, other workers or processes don't get stuck waiting for a locked row to be released; they simply move on to the next available task.</p><p>By using these two clauses together, you can ensure that tasks in your queue are processed smoothly and efficiently, with each task getting picked up by a single worker and other workers moving seamlessly to the next available task.</p><p>However, how can we take this one step further? Many queue implementations have us using FOR UPDATE to mark a message as “in progress” which is great. However, that typically requires us to have a service external to postgres which monitors the queue to check for messages which have been “in progress” for too long.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="self-regulating-queues-in-postgresql">Self-Regulating Queues in PostgreSQL<a href="#self-regulating-queues-in-postgresql" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Self-Regulating Queues in PostgreSQL" title="Direct link to Self-Regulating Queues in PostgreSQL">​</a></h2><p>If you’re using FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, and setting messages “in progress”, you most likely need a process to watch your queue and check for messages that have been processing for too long. Rather than running a background worker or external process, PGMQ implements a Visibility Timeout (VT). A VT is a designated period during which a message, once read from the queue, becomes invisible to other consumers or workers. This ensures that once a worker picks up a task, other workers won't attempt to process the same task for the duration of this timeout. If the original worker fails to complete the task within the specified timeout, the task becomes visible again by nature of time elapsing past the specified VT, which means PGMQ still provides an at-least-once delivery guarantee even when the VT has elapsed. The task is ready for reprocessing by the same or a different worker.</p><p>In essence, the visibility timeout provides a grace period for tasks to be processed. It becomes a buffer against potential failures, ensuring that if a task isn’t completed due to any unforeseen reasons, it doesn’t get lost but rather re-enters the queue. Without something like the VT, queue systems will need to run a process to watch the queue. If that watcher crashes, or loses connection, then messages will stay unavailable until the watcher is recovered.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="queue-regulation-isnt-just-for-error-modes">Queue regulation isn’t just for error modes<a href="#queue-regulation-isnt-just-for-error-modes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Queue regulation isn’t just for error modes" title="Direct link to Queue regulation isn’t just for error modes">​</a></h2><p>A common use case is for a consumer that needs to process a long-running I/O bound task. Let’s say there is a message with a task to create some infrastructure in your favorite <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud provider</a>, e.g. create an EC2 instance if it doesn’t already exist. That could take minutes to start up. Your consumer can submit the request to provision EC2, and then instead of waiting for EC2 to create, it can set the VT on that message to 60 seconds from now, then move on to read the next message. In 60 seconds, the message will become visible again and can be picked up.  That can look something like the follow pseudo-code:</p><div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_D5yF"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_RMoD thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_AclH"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"># read a message, make it invisible for 30 seconds</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">select pgmq.read(‘task_queue’, 30, 1)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">...check if S3 bucket already already created</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">...request to create S3 bucket if not exists</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"># set message VT to 60 seconds from now If not exists: </span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">select pgmq.set_vt(‘task_queue’, &lt;msg_id&gt;, 60)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"># consumer archives or deletes the message when its finished with its job</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">select pgmq.archive('test_queue', &lt;msg_id&gt;)</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_aaMX"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_z5j7" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_FoOz"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_L0B6"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>With PGMQ’s design, messages do not leave the queue until they are explicitly archived or deleted, so you could think of using the VT directly as “returning the message to the queue”, even though it technically never left the queue. Rather, returning it to a state that can be read by other consumers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="choose-the-simplest-queue-architecture-with-pgmq">Choose the simplest queue architecture with PGMQ<a href="#choose-the-simplest-queue-architecture-with-pgmq" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Choose the simplest queue architecture with PGMQ" title="Direct link to Choose the simplest queue architecture with PGMQ">​</a></h2><p>Use <code>FOR UPDATE</code> so that you ensure messages are only read by one consumer at time. <code>SKIP LOCKED</code> so that you can have multiple workers processing messages concurrently. Finally, implement a visibility timeout so that you no longer need to rely on an external process to handle messages that have failed to process.

I'm Ry Walker, founder of Tembo, a managed Postgres company. And today I have Burak from Ubicloud. How do you say UB? Ubi.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000023---burak"><em>[00:00:23]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000023---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000023---burak" title="Direct link to 000023---burak">​</a></h5><p>Ubicloud.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000024---ry"><em>[00:00:24]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000024---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000024---ry" title="Direct link to 000024---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, UB. Welcome to the podcast Burak.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000033---burak"><em>[00:00:33]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000033---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000033---burak" title="Direct link to 000033---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, thanks a lot for having me here.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000036---ry"><em>[00:00:36]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000036---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000036---ry" title="Direct link to 000036---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, well I'd love to start with giving us a quick background. I'm curious where'd you grow up and what were you doing before?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000048---burak"><em>[00:00:48]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000048---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000048---burak" title="Direct link to 000048---burak">​</a></h5><p>Well, well hello everyone, this is Burak and I work as a software developer and I guess in reverse chronological order I worked at Microsoft, Citus Data and SAP on distributed databases in all three and currently I worked at a startup called Ubicloud. We are basically building a new cloud provider and the primary thing we do differently than other providers is that well all the code is open. You can think it as open alternative to existing cloud providers. You can go to GitHub, check out the code, set it up on a bare meta server and then you can have your own cloud or you can use our managed offering of course. So yeah, this is brief history of me working professionally.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000146---ry"><em>[00:01:46]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000146---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000146---ry" title="Direct link to 000146---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, nice. So you're open sourcing, essentially open sourcing and what AWS and GCP and Azure have done.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000155---burak"><em>[00:01:55]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000155---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000155---burak" title="Direct link to 000155---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, definitely, I'm seeing it what Linux is to proprietary operating systems. This is what we are doing for the cloud providers.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000207---ry"><em>[00:02:07]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000207---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000207---ry" title="Direct link to 000207---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, and you only have to build 300 different services on top of it. Right, but luckily a lot of those are open source too.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000215---burak"><em>[00:02:15]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000215---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000215---burak" title="Direct link to 000215---burak">​</a></h5><p>Kind of. Well, I guess our current plan is not building all 200 render services because most of the time people use only ten at most 20. If you implement 20 of them, I guess you have 80% of the use cases. So I guess this is our initial plan but we never know what would feature show.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000242---ry"><em>[00:02:42]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000242---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000242---ry" title="Direct link to 000242---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think it's a great idea. I'm excited to watch it evolve and hopefully partner with you guys at some point.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000250---burak"><em>[00:02:50]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000250---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000250---burak" title="Direct link to 000250---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that would be awesome.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000252---ry"><em>[00:02:52]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000252---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000252---ry" title="Direct link to 000252---ry">​</a></h5><p>Do you remember when you first started using Postgres?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000257---burak"><em>[00:02:57]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000257---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000257---burak" title="Direct link to 000257---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I do. Well to be honest, when I start programming I started as a web developer and at that time Lamp stack was very common. So my first database was MySQL but then I started working at Citus Data and which is the place that I started working development part of the Postgres. So basically for people who don't know Site, the Sitestata was the company behind many popular extensions such as Citus or Pgcron or PostgreSQL HLL. So when I first joined Citus Data, I initially worked on building Citus extension and while doing that you need to dig to the Postgres code first you need to understand and then you build your extension on top of it. And then we built our own managed service. So I switched to that team to build a Postgres managed service and some of our customers were well, they were heavily using PostgresQL HLL extension and at that time the original authors of the PostgreSQL HLL extension, they went through an acquisition process and they didn't have enough time at their hand to maintain the extension. And well, we know the people and at that time PostgreSQL Community was much smaller.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000437---burak"><em>[00:04:37]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000437---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000437---burak" title="Direct link to 000437---burak">​</a></h5><p>So we just called them and said that, hey, we want to maintain this extension, what do you think about? And they were pretty happy to find a new maintainer. So, long story short, I found myself as the maintainer of the PostgreSQL extension and then the Citus Data got acquired by Microsoft and then well, I continued my Postgres journey on Microsoft. Like we also build a managed server stash. Yeah, I guess that's how I start with Postgres development. Well, not just start like till the almost whole journey.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000518---ry"><em>[00:05:18]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000518---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000518---ry" title="Direct link to 000518---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. And are you taking a little bit of a break from it right now or are you working on Postgres stuff over at Ubicloud?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000531---burak"><em>[00:05:31]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000531---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000531---burak" title="Direct link to 000531---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, first of all, we use Postgres in Ubicloud as like most of my professional community, like the friends, and they are from Postgres Community, so there's no way I can leave that community at all. But as a cloud provider, Ubicloud also needs to offer a Postgres service. So we are planning some things like it's not very well defined yet, but I think eventually we will have something for Postgres as well.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000612---ry"><em>[00:06:12]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000612---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000612---ry" title="Direct link to 000612---ry">​</a></h5><p>Out of curiosity, are you guys I'm sure this is a hotly debated topic, but Kubernetes or no Kubernetes inside of UBI Cloud?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000622---burak"><em>[00:06:22]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000622---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000622---burak" title="Direct link to 000622---burak">​</a></h5><p>Well, in our case right now, no Kubernetes. We have pretty simple control plane, which if you want, I think you can move it to Kubernetes. But right now we don't use it. Not that we have anything against Kubernetes, it's just I guess right now we don't need that complexity, I believe.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000650---ry"><em>[00:06:50]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000650---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000650---ry" title="Direct link to 000650---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, and I imagine you'll have managed Kubernetes. You'd have to have that. That'll be one of your 1st 20 most likely.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000657---burak"><em>[00:06:57]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000657---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000657---burak" title="Direct link to 000657---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, definitely. Because managed Kubernetes is quite one of the most demanded products, so it needs to be one of the first.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000711---ry"><em>[00:07:11]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000711---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000711---ry" title="Direct link to 000711---ry">​</a></h5><p>Well, so again, you were working on Citus...When you started working on it, was it an extension or was it, I don't know the full history? Was it a fork at any point and then became extension?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000725---burak"><em>[00:07:25]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000725---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000725---burak" title="Direct link to 000725---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, at the beginning it was a fork and just before I joined the team it become an extension. So basically Citus become an extension and become an open source at the same time. And I think I joined Citus team in like one month after that. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000745---ry"><em>[00:07:45]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000745---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000745---ry" title="Direct link to 000745---ry">​</a></h5><p>Got it. So you never were part of that previous era. Were a lot of the hard problems already solved, would you say, with Citus? Usually. I just did a talk with the PostGIS team and they said early on is where they solved the most of the problems and it was more gradual after that. Is that the case with Citus too, or was there a big project that happened after you joined well, I think.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000819---burak"><em>[00:08:19]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#000819---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000819---burak" title="Direct link to 000819---burak">​</a></h5><p>Most of the difficult problems were already solved and to be honest, I think one of the problems with the extension development is that there isn't good documentation about it. Like for Postgres has pretty good documentation for user facing features. But if you want to as a developer, there isn't that much resources so you usually need to read lots of Postgres code. And to be honest, I think Postgres code is pretty readable for a project at its size and that big and that old, so I think that's a huge plus. But still you need to read lots of code to understand what you need to do. And in our case, thankfully, Citrus hired one of the most prominent contributors of the Postgres Andres Freund and he primarily lead the effort to make Citus an extension. And I think at that time I believe Postgres extension framework also didn't have some of the features we need. So we had to do some hacky workaround. But eventually Postgres extension framework also got improved and we had chance to remove those hacky workaround.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000948---ry"><em>[00:09:48]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000948---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000948---ry" title="Direct link to 000948---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's great. Yeah, it sounds like that's happening now with lots know a lot of the innovation in Postgres happens as a fork with the hope that in a version or two can become an extension and then maybe a couple of versions. After that it becomes a less hacky extension. Right? You can streamline it, but it's a four year journey or so. Tell me about PostgreSQL HLL. Tell me what's HLL stand for.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001019---burak"><em>[00:10:19]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001019---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001019---burak" title="Direct link to 001019---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, HLL stands for Hyperlog log and it is an extension to make a cardinality estimation, which is a fancy way of saying doing count distinct but approximately. Let me first explain why approximately. The reason is doing count distinct as an accurate number is pretty difficult. Well, not difficult, but maybe unfeasible. If your data size is small, that's okay. But if you have lots of data, the usual way is keeping a hash map or hash set. Every time you see an item you put it to hash set and at the end you count number of items in it. But if you have lots of data that becomes unfeasible. If you have a distributed system, like if you are doing count testing in two different nodes, that becomes even more difficult. Because let's say you bite the bullet and calculate the counter stick in one node and the other node, it's not possible to merge the result. Because there might be common elements, you cannot just sum them up. So what Hyperlog log does is it uses an approximation algorithm. I can go into detail of it as well to have an internal representation of the number of unique elements which is both memory efficient compared to doing a hash map which is also easy to merge.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001204---burak"><em>[00:12:04]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001204---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001204---burak" title="Direct link to 001204---burak">​</a></h5><p>So it allows you to do like the parallel computing. And the only gotcha is it is not an exact number, it's an approximation, but it turns out that we don't need exact number most of the time. Like for example, especially in analytical use cases, let's say you want to count the number of unique users that visit your website. It doesn't matter if they are 4 million or 4.1 million, like you want a ballpark number. And also the good thing is the error rate of hyperlog log is quite small. It is usually around 2% and you can make it even smaller if you give it a bit more memory like you can make it more accurate while this hyperlog log algorithm is just out there. And what PostgreSQL hyperlog log does is it implements this algorithm for PostgreSQL.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001309---ry"><em>[00:13:09]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001309---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001309---ry" title="Direct link to 001309---ry">​</a></h5><p>So how much of a resource reduction would you estimate that using an approximation? So you lose a percentage or two of accuracy, but you get how much less compute required?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001324---burak"><em>[00:13:24]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001324---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001324---burak" title="Direct link to 001324---burak">​</a></h5><p>Well, usually it's about 1.5 KB. So the hyperlogo data structure on default it takes about 1.5 KB memory.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001338---ry"><em>[00:13:38]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001338---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001338---ry" title="Direct link to 001338---ry">​</a></h5><p>Orders of magnitude smaller.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001340---burak"><em>[00:13:40]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001340---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001340---burak" title="Direct link to 001340---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, actually log log parts come from that. So if you are dealing with 32 bit integers, it can go up to two to the 32. You get the log of that, it is 32. You get another log that you get five. So you need five bits of memory to be able to store one bucket. And then what hyperlog log does is it keeps multiple buckets to increase the accuracy. So at the end it end up about like 1.5 kilobyte.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001417---ry"><em>[00:14:17]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001417---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001417---ry" title="Direct link to 001417---ry">​</a></h5><p>Got it. So how involved were you in that extension? Did you start it or did you inherit it?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001425---burak"><em>[00:14:25]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001425---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001425---burak" title="Direct link to 001425---burak">​</a></h5><p>I inherited it. So actually another startup called Aggregate Knowledge built that extension. Then I think they got acquired by New Star and at that time the project was not maintained frequently. So there were some boxes we need to be merged in and our customers were also using it. So we contacted the original authors and said that hey, we want to maintain this. And they were happy to hand over the maintainership to us. And then after that we did bug fixes, we did regular releases. I presented a few conference talks about hyperlog log  in Pgcomp EU and Pgcomp US. Yeah, that's the overall story.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001524---ry"><em>[00:15:24]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001524---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001524---ry" title="Direct link to 001524---ry">​</a></h5><p>I'm curious, have you been able to disconnect from I imagine it's easier to disconnect from Citus as an extension after leaving Microsoft, but disconnecting from this extension PostgreSQL HLL.

Well, for example, there were few improvements that I wanted to do, but I didn't have time while working at Microsoft and it just, itched me from time to time and it is open source. So I guess at some point in near future I'll open a pull request and hopefully it would get merged. I hope.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001619---ry"><em>[00:16:19]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001619---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001619---ry" title="Direct link to 001619---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, but Microsoft team controls that extension as it sits.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001625---burak"><em>[00:16:25]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001625---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001625---burak" title="Direct link to 001625---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, right now Microsoft team controls, they continue to do regular releases and every time new PostgreSQL version comes up they ensure that it works well and they update the packages, release new packages.

How many total extensions would you say like Microsoft has in Postgres? I know maybe it's hard to nail down a number, but there are a bunch of others too.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001701---burak"><em>[00:17:01]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001701---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001701---burak" title="Direct link to 001701---burak">​</a></h5><p>There are there's Citus, there's PostgresQL HLL. There is Pgcron which is also quite popular. It is a Chrome based job scheduler.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001710---ry"><em>[00:17:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001710---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001710---ry" title="Direct link to 001710---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I just started using that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001712---burak"><em>[00:17:12]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001712---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001712---burak" title="Direct link to 001712---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's pretty cool. It is primarily developed by Marco Slot. There is one extension to ensure that Postgres works. Postgres is well integrated with Azure. So there's like an extension called PG Azure. I think it's not open source but if you start a Postgres instance from Azure and check the extensions, if there's that extension there is TopN which is also approximation based extension. It gives you top N elements of a sorted list. And if you think about it is also expensive operation to do on big data set because you need to sort them first and take the top N. And I think there are more optimized algorithms that where you can keep heap which is more memory efficient but you still need to go over lots of data at that time. At Citus we also developed this TopN extension. Actually, if you look at it, the general team is about being able to do things at scale because Postgres is already pretty good at doing things in a single node. And like the title primary use case was make. A distributed PostgreSQL and we developed few extensions to make some operations that are not feasible to do at scale and find a ways to make them more feasible.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001906---ry"><em>[00:19:06]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001906---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001906---ry" title="Direct link to 001906---ry">​</a></h5><p>So I'm curious, are there some big milestones in Postgres that you're looking forward to?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001914---burak"><em>[00:19:14]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#001914---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001914---burak" title="Direct link to 001914---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, actually I was looking forward for Postgres 16 release mostly because of the logical replication improvement. There are few and I think there will be more upcoming because I think logical replication is a very powerful concept but it's still a bit cumbersome to use it with PostgreSQL, especially when there's a change in the data, like if when you run a DDL command or when you have a failover. So there are few gotcha and I think with the Postgres 16 some of these are less problematic and maybe I hope in the upcoming versions it would be even easier to use. Well, when you have a very solid logical replication, it opens up lots of cool features. Well, one thing that I personally invested in is being able to do zero downtime failovers and when I say zero time downtime, I mean like the real zero downtime. Not just like 1 second downtime, but real zero downtime. And I think logical replication, solid logical replication would open up that yeah, I agree.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002045---ry"><em>[00:20:45]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002045---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002045---ry" title="Direct link to 002045---ry">​</a></h5><p>It's one thing to do that too with a single node versus a Citus cluster too right. Zero downtime gets complicated the more complicated your deployment is. But I agree on a single deployment I have this idea where we could basically build scaffolding around the existing thing, whatever it takes, like get another one working. In other words, temporarily have replication happening and then somehow seamlessly up above you have to have some fulcrum that you can so it's a complicated thing to figure out but I think it'd be great for a managed service provider to basically build up temporary infrastructure that helps the zero downtime thing happen. If that's true, then you can restart for all kinds of reasons with impunity like auto scaling is possible, stuff like that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002150---burak"><em>[00:21:50]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#002150---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002150---burak" title="Direct link to 002150---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, and one reason I especially interested in was that in our previous managed service we do lots of operations via failover. Like for example, if you want to scale up what we would do is we create another server with higher number of cores and then we would do failover. Or if you want to like for example, we might need to do maintenance like maybe we found a security vulnerability or there is the regular maintenance. What we would do is instead of going and patching the existing server we would create a new one and then we do a failover to that one and each of those failovers. It takes some amount of downtime which is not obviously not preferable and not a good experience for customers but if they were virtually free from the perspective of customer if they don't even notice that there's a failover then you can do as many failovers as you want.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002255---ry"><em>[00:22:55]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002255---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002255---ry" title="Direct link to 002255---ry">​</a></h5><p>You share the same vision as I do there. I think it would be exciting to get there. So I'm curious though, if there was one thing that you could if you had a magic wand and this weekend something new would be in Postgres core, what would it be? What would you use that wand on?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002311---burak"><em>[00:23:11]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#002311---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002311---burak" title="Direct link to 002311---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's difficult. I want lots of things like picking one is difficult but I guess one thing that bothers me is that for high availability and backups you always need to depend the third party tool I would really love that to be sold in Postgres. Like for example, for Redis it comes with very good default settings that you can use for high availability. But for Postgres there are solutions. There are good solutions but I would love them to be in the core.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002403---ry"><em>[00:24:03]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002403---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002403---ry" title="Direct link to 002403---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I get that for sure. It's tricky when you have to buy a product or let's say you adopt a product and you immediately have to adopt x additional products right off the bat and that's not a good feeling. It feels complex, right? Yeah, that's cool, I would say. Do you have any opinions about Postgres that almost nobody agrees with you about? Are you a contrarian in any area that you can think of?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002435---burak"><em>[00:24:35]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#002435---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002435---burak" title="Direct link to 002435---burak">​</a></h5><p>Let me see.

So instead of having a lot of specialized databases, you can have Postgres. And with some configuration and maybe few extensions, you can implement, like you can implement Kafka in Postgres, you can implement Redis, you can implement like the NoSQL in Postgres. I guess if I said this maybe two, three years ago, probably I would get more raised eye growth. But now I think more people start thinking to think like that. I think Tembo is also thinking things along similar lines, right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002614---ry"><em>[00:26:14]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002614---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002614---ry" title="Direct link to 002614---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think there's openness to it. I talked to a lot of people, and the question is how people are Postgres for everything. Or question is what percentage of developers are actually on that bandwagon? Obviously on Twitter, it just takes one person, and it's a big community, too, especially if it's a contrarian view. But I'm kind of curious. One of the things I want to find out over the next few months is what percentage of developers would actually if this Postgres for Everything was real, would they actually use it versus still saying "Ehh." And I think it all comes down to like I think, yeah, you can do Kafka, like work on Postgres right now, but it doesn't feel as clean as buying Confluent. That seems like a very safe decision. And doing something like Kafka on Postgres seems like you're just kind of stringing together a Rube Goldberg machine and it doesn't feel like a solid. But the question is, if those solutions were solid, would people use them? And that's our big thesis, is that if they were solid, people would use them. But I just don't know what percentage of people would do that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002738---ry"><em>[00:27:38]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002738---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002738---ry" title="Direct link to 002738---ry">​</a></h5><p>A big percentage or a small percentage?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002740---burak"><em>[00:27:40]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#002740---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002740---burak" title="Direct link to 002740---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I'm not sure. But there is one interesting thing that come into my mind, is, well, today Postgres supports JSONB type, but it was not like that all the time. So in the earlier days, if you want to store JSON data, we had an extension called hstore, which we still have, but not as commonly used as before. And what hstore does is, and this is one of the very powerful part of PostgreSQL extension framework, hstore defined the data type, and on top of it, they defined how you can hash this data type and how you can compare this data type. And when you do this in Postgres, Postgres allows you to create index on that data type. So suddenly you are not only able to store JSON data, but you can index it. And at that time this is kind of rare things even for NoSQL database. So I think it's a bit funny. And also it shows the power of PostgreSQL extension framework is that suddenly you are able to do what NoSQL database does but better. I mean, not in all perspectives, like connection scaling was still a problem, but being able to index NoSQL data, being able to index JSON, it was a rare feature even for NoSQL databases.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002919---burak"><em>[00:29:19]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#002919---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002919---burak" title="Direct link to 002919---burak">​</a></h5><p>But you had it in Postgres. I don't know, maybe some of these other databases or other use cases Postgres might have something unexpected that would make it better.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002936---ry"><em>[00:29:36]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002936---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002936---ry" title="Direct link to 002936---ry">​</a></h5><p>An unexpected advantage. Yeah, it's the same way with pgvector right now the great thing about doing vector embeddings inside of Postgres is that you don't have to move the data out of Postgres as part of the process. Right. You can just add a column and keep it where it is, whereas anybody else has if it's an external vector database that's specific for that use case, you have to have data pipelines and all that kind of machinery. Which that's to me, one of the big benefits of keeping it all in Postgres is less data movement. And less data movement can mean much like no data delays and all that kind of stuff go away. So yeah, I agree with you, there's a lot of unexpected benefits for keeping things together.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003025---burak"><em>[00:30:25]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#003025---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003025---burak" title="Direct link to 003025---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I guess since Postgres provides pretty strong asset guarantees, it allows you to build things on top of that. And when you have asset, then you can be much more free to develop complex features. Because what I realize is like while developing software, most of the time as a developer, I try to ensure that hey, what I'm doing is atomic or what I'm doing does not it is isolate. So it's not caused any problems if something is coming and not in the expected order. But you have chance to delegate all this to Postgres, I think that gives you quite a bit of advantage.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003121---ry"><em>[00:31:21]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003121---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003121---ry" title="Direct link to 003121---ry">​</a></h5><p>Well, one of the things I love too is that because the Postgres core team is quite separated from the commercial products, is that I just think it seems like a very stable chassis to build these things on top of. And you really can't if it's more of a captive, open source project, say, like what Kafka is to Confluent. They can move Kafka quickly if they need to for commercial to help their commercial product, but that could introduce more instability. I just don't see this Postgres team doing anything very risky, which to me is a great counterbalance to people developers trying to move fast and build crazy cool new things. It's just nice to have that as a stability factor, I think, inside the product.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003217---burak"><em>[00:32:17]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#003217---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003217---burak" title="Direct link to 003217---burak">​</a></h5><p>I think so, yeah. Well, I guess historically I think the Postgres community kind of divided into camps and some of them would want to implement new shiny thing and some of them would try to hey, just let's get stabilized. And I believe this JSONB support comes from the part who wants to innovate and try new things. And at the beginning, I think they got some hesitation from the other company. But at the end, I guess what they do proved itself to be very valuable. And then now JSONB support is one of the most widely used features of Postgres. Yeah, so I guess there is some sort of balance to try risky things and also try being stabilized.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003310---ry"><em>[00:33:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003310---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003310---ry" title="Direct link to 003310---ry">​</a></h5><p>If you look at the number of the change log for Postgres 16 they did a lot of things. It's almost more than anyone can keep in their head. That's what I'm saying. The good stuff gets through, it's just the bar is high and then with a lot of assurances that they didn't break any part of Postgres in the process. I really appreciate that part of this thing and it's one of the reasons why I'm so excited to be building a product on top of it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003341---burak"><em>[00:33:41]<!-- --> - Burak</em><a href="#003341---burak" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003341---burak" title="Direct link to 003341---burak">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, at the same time it is sometimes bit frustrating because sometimes you have a feature you want it to be merged in like you might be author or you might be just someone watching from the site and desperately need that feature. And then you see that there is a huge discussion going on and people cannot convince each other and it falls to the next cycle, which is like the one years later. So that's a bit frustrating but I guess yeah, it is kind of cost of having a quite stable system.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003418---ry"><em>[00:34:18]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003418---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003418---ry" title="Direct link to 003418---ry">​</a></h5><p>It's the cost. And like I said, well, obviously I haven't been here for the 26 years watching the mailing lists and maybe I'm jumping in here relatively late in a cycle and I just appreciate all the efforts and all the debates and all the fights that have happened there because I think it's created such a great core engine.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="alt_text" src="/assets/images/tembo_ele-7c81c53d1131a1b7fcca53d6ff51ed82.png" title="Tembo the Operator" width="1784" height="1706" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>So you have a database, and that database does something. (Probably several somethings, if we're honest). However, today, you need it to do something else. </p><p>Simple enough...you just create a tool to give it that new functionality. Job done.</p><p>Except it isn't. Because the requests for new "things" never stop. They get complicated. They slow things down. They conflict with one another. Sometimes they even screw up your database along the way. And if we're honest, you don't really want to be constantly building new tools for every new need anyway. Before you know it, all of these "things" you're asking the database to do are starting to get in the way of its core performance.</p><p>The good news is that Postgres has a rich ecosystem of tools and services built by the community. Many of these run in the database as Postgres extensions, while others run outside the database as external services. Some of the most well known examples are <a href="https://postgrest.org/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostgREST</a>, an out-of-the box REST API for Postgres and <a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/usage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pgbouncer</a>, a production ready connection pooler. A scalable way to run these pieces of software with the Tembo operator is to utilize a new feature called Application Services, which runs these applications in containers next to postgres.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="understanding-the-essence-of-tembo-operator">Understanding the Essence of Tembo Operator<a href="#understanding-the-essence-of-tembo-operator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understanding the Essence of Tembo Operator" title="Direct link to Understanding the Essence of Tembo Operator">​</a></h2><p>We have developed the Tembo Operator looking to add new capabilities for developers and enterprises. We believe that it stands out from other techniques in many ways, and in particular, one important feature is that it lets users deploy applications in containers right alongside their PostgreSQL instances, ensuring efficient connection to Postgres with very low latency.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="the-advantage-of-running-applications-in-separate-containers">The Advantage of Running Applications in Separate Containers<a href="#the-advantage-of-running-applications-in-separate-containers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Advantage of Running Applications in Separate Containers" title="Direct link to The Advantage of Running Applications in Separate Containers">​</a></h2><p>PostgreSQL is a very powerful piece of software. When running in Kubernetes, a useful pattern is to run important applications in a separate container, in the same namespace. By running these applications in separate containers, we isolate application requirements, such as resource allocations. This means that each container can have dedicated CPU and Memory, ensuring there's no competition with the resources reserved for running PostgreSQL. This segregation ensures that the Postgres database and other applications can function and scale efficiently.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="spotlight-on-postgrest-a-prime-example">Spotlight on PostgREST: A Prime Example<a href="#spotlight-on-postgrest-a-prime-example" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spotlight on PostgREST: A Prime Example" title="Direct link to Spotlight on PostgREST: A Prime Example">​</a></h2><p>PostgREST is a perfect example where an application can run with this pattern. PostgREST serves as a standalone web server that turns your database directly into a RESTful API. The immediate advantage? Developers can use the auto-generated API to build robust applications without writing any code. By simplifying the process and reducing the need for middleware, PostgREST has become a popular tool in the Postgres ecosystem.</p><p>However, let’s remember that  the main advantage of this method is not just resource allocation. It's about ensuring the optimal performance of Postgres without bogging it down with additional tasks. </p><p>Let’s look at an example of a spec that would run the workload that we just described. This will look familiar if you’ve worked with the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes Pod spec.</a></p><div

operator always starts postgres with default configurations, so let’s focus on the <code>appServices</code> section of the spec, which will tell us what and how we’ll run an application container.</p><p>We can run any number of applications in containers near the Postgres instance. Only the <code>name</code> and <code>image</code> parameters are required, but you can configure commands, arguments, environment variables, CPU and memory, and readiness and liveness probes for the application.</p><p>If you need network communication, you can also configure the ingress by specifying a port and a path. In our example, postgREST runs on port 3000 and expects traffic routed to the root path. appServices also support various Middleware configurations, but we will cover those in a future blog.</p><p>Environment variables also have some advanced configuration. The Tembo operator creates a few roles in Postgres, and tracks those credentials in a Kubernetes secret. If we want to pull those credentials into an application, we can do so by using the <code>valueFromPlatform</code> option. The service currently supports pulling in credentials for <code>ReadWriteConnection</code>, <code>ReadOnlyConnection</code> but we’ll be building out more role assignments soon.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="arbitrary-container-deployments">Arbitrary container deployments<a href="#arbitrary-container-deployments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Arbitrary container deployments" title="Direct link to Arbitrary container deployments">​</a></h2><p>The Tembo operator is not limited to postgREST; it can run nearly any containerized application.

Running this with the Tembo Operator makes it simple to get these services up and running.</p><p>And if you want to try out the full power of Postgres without being concerned with how it will run, try out <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Cloud</a>.Drop into our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/tembocommunity/shared_invite/zt-20dtnhcmo-pLNV7_Aobi50TdTLpfQ~EQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> channel to ask questions and get help from the Tembo team and other community members.</p>]]></content>

And today I have Regina Obe and Paul Ramsey, two who are working and have been working on PostGIS for quite some time. Welcome to the show, both of you.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000028---regina"><em>[00:00:28]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000028---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000028---regina" title="Direct link to 000028---regina">​</a></h5><p>Thanks, Ry.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000028---paul"><em>[00:00:28]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000028---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000028---paul" title="Direct link to 000028---paul">​</a></h5><p>Thanks, Ry. Nice to be here. Great. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000032---ry"><em>[00:00:32]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000032---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000032---ry" title="Direct link to 000032---ry">​</a></h5><p>So I think you guys have all been using Postgres for quite some time. Maybe. Paul, when did you start using Postgres?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000042---paul"><em>[00:00:42]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000042---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000042---paul" title="Direct link to 000042---paul">​</a></h5><p>I started using Postgres, and I'm sure I can give you a version number, I think like 6.4, which I think puts me in like the '98, '99 era. And yeah, I was using it as a consultant. My first career was in consulting and working for the provincial government. And we were doing a big data analysis project and it was a geospatial project, but all the geospatial processing was being done by an external piece of software and we used Postgres as the backing store for what was a very long, like, 20 day compute cycle to spit out all the results for the entire province. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000117---ry"><em>[00:01:17]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000117---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000117---ry" title="Direct link to 000117---ry">​</a></h5><p>Nice. How about you, Regina?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000118---regina"><em>[00:01:18]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000118---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000118---regina" title="Direct link to 000118---regina">​</a></h5><p>I started out as a SQL Server person, so yeah, Paul dragged me into Postgres. So my first introduction was via PostGIS in 2001, I think it was. So it was like 7.1 or 7.3, I can't remember somewhere between 7.1 and 7.3.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000139---paul"><em>[00:01:39]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000139---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000139---paul" title="Direct link to 000139---paul">​</a></h5><p>It was 7.1 because that was the first version of Postgres that you could actually do a geospatial extension. Oh, nice.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000145---ry"><em>[00:01:45]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000145---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000145---ry" title="Direct link to 000145---ry">​</a></h5><p>And do you regret leaving SQL Server?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000149---regina"><em>[00:01:49]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000149---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000149---regina" title="Direct link to 000149---regina">​</a></h5><p>Well, I still consult for SQL Server, and what's interesting about that is I think I've gotten to be a better SQL Server expert knowing Postgres because Postgres would always introduce things first, like all the lead functions, all the window functions, Postgres introduced those before SQL Server had them and the CTEs and everything.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000218---ry"><em>[00:02:18]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000218---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000218---ry" title="Direct link to 000218---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, got it. What's the state of geospatial in Microsoft SQL Server, would you say compared to Postgres? I don't know too much about that ecosystem, but I'm curious, how much parity have they achieved?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000232---regina"><em>[00:02:32]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000232---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000232---regina" title="Direct link to 000232---regina">​</a></h5><p>Well, I think their geography is still better than ours, but in terms of the geometry support, they're way behind, which is what most of the state people care about.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000242---ry"><em>[00:02:42]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000242---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000242---ry" title="Direct link to 000242---ry">​</a></h5><p>Awesome. Cool. All right, well, I'm going to kind of go off my standard script because how long have you guys been working on PostGIS for? This is one of the oldest extensions, or is it the oldest extension?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000259---paul"><em>[00:02:59]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000259---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000259---paul" title="Direct link to 000259---paul">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, I mean, so when we started extension, this didn't exist. It's a pre extension as a package concept. It's just like the idea of runtime, adding things at runtime to the database which was there from the very beginning. That was a stonebreaker original. Like, this is one of the things Postgres can do. PostGIS is from 2001, as Regina mentioned, she started using it within three months of the initial release. So, yeah, may of 2001. So yeah, we're at 22 years.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000328---ry"><em>[00:03:28]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000328---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000328---ry" title="Direct link to 000328---ry">​</a></h5><p>So how has it, has it changed much? Would you say since? Has it been pretty steady progress towards what it is now? Or were there any big milestones, big changes that you can remember that are super noteworthy?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000342---paul"><em>[00:03:42]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000342---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000342---paul" title="Direct link to 000342---paul">​</a></h5><p>It has not been like one linear rise. It's definitely been punctuated equilibrium. And as these things go, the most new features and new capabilities happen right at the start, because we started with nothing, right? We started with first release. It had geospatial types, it had a geospatial index. It had eight functions, I think only one of which was analytical in any way. But that was like release 0.1 in 2001. I think we got to 0.8 in two years, like 2003. And that had the first full set of spatial functions where you could really test all the relationships between the geometries. You could do constructive geometry operations like buffering intersections and unions and so on in the geometries, that was the really big like, you could have stopped there in many respects. If you look at what SQL Server has, that's kind of what they did until 2008. They had no spatial at all. And then they came out with their spatial extension, which was basically what they have now because it was a capable, complete vector spatial database, full stop. But since then, we've kept adding stuff. Maybe Regina will take another tour of what she thinks the biggest things to happen since 0.8 were yeah, so I.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000508---regina"><em>[00:05:08]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000508---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000508---regina" title="Direct link to 000508---regina">​</a></h5><p>Think PostGIS just improved as Postgres improved. So they introduced Gist and all our indexes changed from the old R-tree to the Gist index. They improved aggregation in Postgres, which I think was a huge milestone for us because a lot of the processing we do involves aggregating geometries together. So we would see something like from a tenfold speed improvement in terms of aggregation of geometries. And then the other things. I think CTEs were pretty useful. Now, nobody does any queries in Spatial without using a CTE anymore.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000601---ry"><em>[00:06:01]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000601---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000601---ry" title="Direct link to 000601---ry">​</a></h5><p>Would you say, like those advances in Postgres? I don't know. Let's say that they did 80% of the work towards the thing working ten times faster, and you guys had to do 20%. Or what was the ratio of effort from where were you getting great improvements virtually for free without any effort on your side?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000621---regina"><em>[00:06:21]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000621---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000621---regina" title="Direct link to 000621---regina">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think we were getting great improvements for free, pretty much.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000625---ry"><em>[00:06:25]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000625---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000625---ry" title="Direct link to 000625---ry">​</a></h5><p>Oh, that's great.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000625---regina"><em>[00:06:25]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000625---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000625---regina" title="Direct link to 000625---regina">​</a></h5><p>And then there's the whole KNN thing, which they drastically improved from 9.2 to yeah, I was making fun of Bruce, and then Bruce said, I can't believe you'd have to do that. We need to fix it. And so after 9.2, the KNN became real KNN instead of just box KNN. But yeah, in all those cases, there wasn't that much we needed to do to get the improvement.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000649---paul"><em>[00:06:49]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000649---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000649---paul" title="Direct link to 000649---paul">​</a></h5><p>Parallelism.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000650---regina"><em>[00:06:50]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000650---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000650---regina" title="Direct link to 000650---regina">​</a></h5><p>Oh, yeah, parallelism.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000651---paul"><em>[00:06:51]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000651---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000651---paul" title="Direct link to 000651---paul">​</a></h5><p>Another one of which is like a huge freebie. Like, look at that. We do parallel processing.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000657---regina"><em>[00:06:57]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000657---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000657---regina" title="Direct link to 000657---regina">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, the only thing we needed to do is tell people how to configure their Postgres comps to take advantage of parallelism.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000705---ry"><em>[00:07:05]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000705---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000705---ry" title="Direct link to 000705---ry">​</a></h5><p>Curious, what kind of challenges did you guys face? I'd say early on building this.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000714---paul"><em>[00:07:14]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000714---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000714---paul" title="Direct link to 000714---paul">​</a></h5><p>The biggest thing? Well, I don't know. There are a lot of things. As a geospatial extension, our code isn't packed like into one hunk of code that we control. We use a lot of library dependencies. And so we end up having, and we still do having a really complex build almost right out of the gate compared to other extensions, because other extensions like, hey, we're a self contained thing. You just type, make and you're done. Whereas with us it was always like, hey, guess what? You get to track down three or four different other libraries in addition to the thing that we have and make sure they're the right versions, and here's the configuration, so on. So we end up with this really naughty configuration setup. And initially, like, if you're going to start using this stuff back in the day, step one was always to build it. They weren't prepackaged. Postgres itself wasn't prepackaged, everything was from source, so it put this fairly steep entryway in for new users.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000814---regina"><em>[00:08:14]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000814---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000814---regina" title="Direct link to 000814---regina">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, although early on, we didn't have any other dependencies except Postgres, so it was much easier.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000819---paul"><em>[00:08:19]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000819---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000819---paul" title="Direct link to 000819---paul">​</a></h5><p>Well GEOS after two years and then, well, proge at the same time. I mean, we had GEOS and proj almost from the start, and then started picking up format libraries after that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000828---regina"><em>[00:08:28]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000828---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000828---regina" title="Direct link to 000828---regina">​</a></h5><p>Do we have proj?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000829---paul"><em>[00:08:29]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000829---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000829---paul" title="Direct link to 000829---paul">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I don't remember projection because proj already existed, so tying it in was a pretty straightforward thing to do.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000835---regina"><em>[00:08:35]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#000835---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000835---regina" title="Direct link to 000835---regina">​</a></h5><p>Okay, I don't remember that. Or maybe it was an optional dependency, so I just never built with it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000843---paul"><em>[00:08:43]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000843---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000843---paul" title="Direct link to 000843---paul">​</a></h5><p>Everything was optional.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000844---ry"><em>[00:08:44]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000844---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000844---ry" title="Direct link to 000844---ry">​</a></h5><p>Tell me what GEOS is. I've seen that mentioned, but I didn't dive in. Is that powering other geospatial solutions besides PostGIS?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000855---paul"><em>[00:08:55]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#000855---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000855---paul" title="Direct link to 000855---paul">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it is. GEOS is an acronym of course, stands for Geometry Engine open source. It provides the computational geometry underpinnings for a bunch of sort of the key functions. I mentioned a buffer, that's a GEOs function at the back end. Intersection is a GEOS function at the back end. The Boolean predicates intersects contains within those are all GEOS functions at the back end. Some of the fancier stuff that we've added to GEOS is now exposed in PostGIS. So if you ask for Delaunay triangles or <!-- -->[...]<!-- --> polygons, you get those from GEOS and then GEOS, because it's like this useful Swiss Army knife of computational geometry is used by other programs in the geospatial ecosystem. So if you use the Google library, it backs out of GEOS for its geospatial operations. And like most prominently, if you use the QGIS desktop GIS, you'll find that the Q just backstops its geospatial algorithms.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000954---ry"><em>[00:09:54]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000954---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000954---ry" title="Direct link to 000954---ry">​</a></h5><p>So did you guys refactor code into that, or did you just end up replacing some stuff you had built early on with that library later on?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001001---regina"><em>[00:10:01]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#001001---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001001---regina" title="Direct link to 001001---regina">​</a></h5><p>Well, Paul started GEOS too.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001004---ry"><em>[00:10:04]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001004---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001004---ry" title="Direct link to 001004---ry">​</a></h5><p>Okay. All, it's okay. So it sounds like refactored into that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001009---regina"><em>[00:10:09]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#001009---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001009---regina" title="Direct link to 001009---regina">​</a></h5><p>Well, not so much refactor. I think it was always kind of a separate thing. Right.

Maybe we should talk about this in the part we have a little get together, because it's one of the things which in front of me lately is like the underlying infrastructure we have for handling rasters was built well, no, 2010, anyways. It was built, like, in an era when the idea of, say, doing cloud based raster processing was kind of not what would be done. It was built around the idea that you would store your own rasters kind of locally in your local area network, that increasingly organizations just don't do that. They still want to have raster access. And while you can do remote raster access with what we have, it's kind of clunky. It's not optimized for that at all. I feel like just like a relook at what the raster use cases are and kind of a reevaluation of whether how we handle rasters is right is due. I was looking at the API that Alibaba offers on their cloud databases and thinking, yeah, that's kind of an interesting way of tackling rasters.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001217---ry"><em>[00:12:17]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001217---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001217---ry" title="Direct link to 001217---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, you're talking about like Alibaba is like a they have a proprietary database or not, their Postgres.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001225---paul"><em>[00:12:25]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#001225---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001225---paul" title="Direct link to 001225---paul">​</a></h5><p>They don't say. They're really cagey about it. So I'm not sure whether it's back then Postgres or not, but their take on rasters is very much all their own.

I don't know the difference. I've not studied how PostGIS works or raster, and it is but I'm curious, is the vector search stuff happening that's happening in the ML space? How closely related is the math of that to the math of I'm sure you've kind of paid a little bit of attention to that space.

At a conceptual level, they're the same. But from a practicality point of view, the practicalities of handling super high dimensional stuff are just different. Like one of the first things you learn, even like we go to four dimensions, even at four dimensions, the indexing properties start to break down if the kind of sort of standard R-tree stuff just doesn't work as nicely. You don't have to get very high up into a complex dimensional space for that form of indexing to be like, it doesn't work, it's not doing what we need to do. And you can really see that in just how different the indexing approaches are for ML vectors compared to sort of 2D vectors.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001410---ry"><em>[00:14:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001410---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001410---ry" title="Direct link to 001410---ry">​</a></h5><p>So, like, high dimensionality just requires an entirely different mindset and solution set.

One of the things that's kind of obvious once you start looking at this stuff is that there's like a project size threshold before you start to see enough money around a project to support full time maintainership or people whose jobs are mostly around the project. And PostGIS is interesting in being like one of the few Postgres extensions which has received achieved that level. But even at that level, it's quite small. So you got Regina, who has a good consulting business. I work for Crunchy Data, which is a professional open source support company, which is to say they sell support contracts to Fortune 100 companies and US Federal government and increasingly a number of international organizations, but of similar size and scale, big organizations. And then also has a software as a service called Crunchy Bridge, which is basically database in the cloud of the sort that everyone's gotten used to.

Yeah. They haven't moved up. That would be a good sort of like example of a productization of PostGIS. Certainly in their earliest incarnation they had a software as a service which did a very good job of allowing you to put data in, visualize it in a whole bunch of ways. And that exposed like SQL as the language for customization of what you were seeing. And it was all sitting on top of PostGIS, but it was marketed as CartoDB. So they had productized around a software service that more or less made the database not invisible, but the actual brand of the database was irrelevant.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001751---ry"><em>[00:17:51]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001751---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001751---ry" title="Direct link to 001751---ry">​</a></h5><p>Do you see real old versions of PostGIS surface?

I'm frequently, frequently surprised by how much internal churn there is because I always feel like, oh, we're the supermature extension. We don't reach like super deep into the extension, like into the into the core. We're not hooking into like executor hooks or planner hooks or stuff like that. And yet there's always this there's always this medium to long list of things that have to be tweaked when you move up to a new, like in terms of our code or for it to build and still run correctly, that have to be tweaked at each major Postgres release.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002057---regina"><em>[00:20:57]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#002057---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002057---regina" title="Direct link to 002057---regina">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, because I can't think of any release we've done that we didn't have to tweak it for the in development major release of Postgres.

I've been watching the decade long crawl towards being able to do a replicated OLAP system where you get full push down to all the nodes. So every release, the Postgres FTW folks from Toshiba and other places add a couple more turns of stuff that you can push down, which is exciting to me because we're that much closer. We're that much closer to be able to do big multi node queries because there's OLAP workloads and LTP workloads for spatial databases. Really, the bias is towards OLAP for sure. In terms of what you see, how you see people using the database. I mean, they like transactionality, they like to be able to manipulate their data. But when it comes time to ask, what is this for? It's like, oh yeah, we run big analyzes. So the ability to push stuff out to multi node as that gets more mature, as it gets more possible, like, that becomes something that's really exciting on the spatial side. So I watch every little tick of the gears towards that endpoint and get very excited. So it's been pushed down in the last couple of releases.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002322---paul"><em>[00:23:22]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#002322---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002322---paul" title="Direct link to 002322---paul">​</a></h5><p>Last release had good stuff around parallelization in the planner and executor as well for partitions, which is like, that's a big deal because the holy grail is you've got your big table partitioned out across the remote nodes. So each of your partition is actually a foreign table. And when you run the query, the planner says, oh, look, I can just ask all the partitions to run it simultaneously, it gets back the result, assembles it and says, Here you go, we're getting close to that. Which would be a big deal because there's a whole bunch of workloads that you can just turn into sort of like a standard OLAP star schema. One big fact table, a bunch of dimensions and you'd be able to do lots of really cool spatial stuff. That right now, not so much. I don't know when we'll ever get to the holy grail, which is to be able be able to do shipping data between nodes in order to allow nodes do things like join across these across two big fact tables. That might never happen. I don't see anyone doing that. But that's the one that would like having me tear my clothes off and dancing in the street.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002434---ry"><em>[00:24:34]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002434---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002434---ry" title="Direct link to 002434---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah.

But to an extent, geospatial formats is a category which also includes non geospatial things because all you have to do is not have the geospatial column and then what do you call it? Oh, it's just a format. So Excel can be a geospatial format. Got it. And it's something that you can read.

OGR is just the vector side of the GDL library, which also has an acronym which is not worth unpacking anymore because it's a 20 year old acronym, but it refers to the library that it's binding. This is the OG library for vector formats? Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002558---ry"><em>[00:25:58]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002558---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002558---ry" title="Direct link to 002558---ry">​</a></h5><p>Cool. Yeah, I'll check that out. That's cool. Kind of wrapping this up on the core. Like if you had a magic wand and you could add any feature to know. Of course, if that was added, then you immediately have work to do in PostGIS as well. But what would your magic wand manifest this weekend in Postgres if you could pick one thing?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002620---regina"><em>[00:26:20]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#002620---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002620---regina" title="Direct link to 002620---regina">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I can't think of any.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002621---paul"><em>[00:26:21]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#002621---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002621---paul" title="Direct link to 002621---paul">​</a></h5><p>I know what Regina's is.

How did you read my mind? I completely forgot about it because I gave up hope on it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002647---ry"><em>[00:26:47]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002647---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002647---ry" title="Direct link to 002647---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, tell me about that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002648---regina"><em>[00:26:48]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#002648---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002648---regina" title="Direct link to 002648---regina">​</a></h5><p>So Sandro, who's also on the PostGIS team, he's been working on an update to the extension machinery that would allow us to reduce our upgrade script to one file because right now we ship like 500 files, which are all pretty much just SIM links to the same thing. And so it's just a way to have the extension machinery understand that, hey, this script can be used to upgrade this version, this version, this version and this version, instead of having to itemize every single version upgrade.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002730---paul"><em>[00:27:30]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#002730---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002730---paul" title="Direct link to 002730---paul">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, the extension upgrade machinery is very clever, but it starts with an immediate assumption, which is that as a developer, you will manage your extension upgrades as incrementals between versions and that it will cleverly find the path through the incrementals from the version you have to the version you're going to, applying all the little slices on the way.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002755---regina"><em>[00:27:55]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#002755---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002755---regina" title="Direct link to 002755---regina">​</a></h5><p>And it uses Dijkstra for that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002758---paul"><em>[00:27:58]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#002758---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002758---paul" title="Direct link to 002758---paul">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it's super clever. Even like in the best case scenario where you'd already been doing that, it's probably not super ideal for any project where the development path isn't linear. So Post just has, I don't know, 25 or so minor releases like X, Y, and then within those, there's maybe five patch releases across each of those. So we'll have a whole bunch of parallel version trees, right? You're on 2.3.5, or you're going to go to 2.3.6, but then you might want to go to 2.4.8. And that means you have to have all these individual even if you're doing things like one tiny step of time, you would have all these individual little hops across the branches. If you have just this one line, it kind of worked. You just sort of chained together this one little line. You don't have very many files when you have all these little branches, all of a sudden you need all these extra little hops across the branches. And it's made worse because all of our management of the SQL side of it, the SQL side of the extension where you define the functions on SQL land and say, oh, it's over here in the dynamic library.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002924---paul"><em>[00:29:24]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#002924---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002924---paul" title="Direct link to 002924---paul">​</a></h5><p>We've been managing that since pre extension world. And our way of managing it was to have a SQL file which can always be cleanly applied against any previous version. So it's quite long because the SQL file has every single definition of every single thing in it. So how you handle the incremental thing from 1.2 to 1.3? Well you have one copy for 1.31 copy for the upgrade as well. So every little upgrade has a full copy of that fairly large SQL file. On Unix systems now we just ship sip links instead of syncing the whole file. But you end up with just a huge pile.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003005---regina"><em>[00:30:05]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#003005---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003005---regina" title="Direct link to 003005---regina">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, actually we changed from that to just a file that has nothing in it. Right. To just on any version which kind.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003013---paul"><em>[00:30:13]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#003013---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003013---paul" title="Direct link to 003013---paul">​</a></h5><p>Of the chain eventually arrives at the full one.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003017---regina"><em>[00:30:17]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#003017---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003017---regina" title="Direct link to 003017---regina">​</a></h5><p>So now that's the same across. But I think ours is more complicated too because for each version we support multiple versions of Postgres and we also enable new features. If you're on like twelve you get something, if you are eleven you don't get that something.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003040---paul"><em>[00:30:40]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#003040---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003040---paul" title="Direct link to 003040---paul">​</a></h5><p>Certainly something which is not contemplated by the original designers is our file. Our input file actually goes through, we put it through the C preprocessor before we give it to Postgres because we have a whole bunch of if defs against what Postgres version you're on. Living inside the SQL file that have to be pre processed before it's usable.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003102---ry"><em>[00:31:02]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003102---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003102---ry" title="Direct link to 003102---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I understand. Was maybe you're saying like the current design is just naive thinking that you're not going to try to support multiple versions of Postgres with one of your versions of the extension and there's not home for that information, I guess for what the range is to some degree.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003122---paul"><em>[00:31:22]<!-- --> - Paul</em><a href="#003122---paul" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003122---paul" title="Direct link to 003122---paul">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I mean although the extension framework does contemplate the idea of versioned extensions, again, it doesn't really contemplate them as anything except for a linear chain. And once you have a more complex situation than that it's kind of hard. Like we for a very long time supported being able to run different versions of PostGIS inside the same Postgres cluster. We still do actually support that, but it's a feature that it seems like mostly OA developers use. So it's optional now and we default just to like one version of Postgres or PostGIS for each Postgres cluster. But that functionality was always there. But the extension facility did not grok that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003205---regina"><em>[00:32:05]<!-- --> - Regina</em><a href="#003205---regina" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003205---regina" title="Direct link to 003205---regina">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, and packagers did not grok that either.

The operator then watches for changes to the custom resource and takes action to reconcile the state of the application’s components with the desired state of the custom resource.</p><p>In short, using a Kubernetes operator is the most effective way to run applications on Kubernetes in 2023.</p><p>You can read more about Kubernetes operators on this <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/06/15/kubernetes-operators-what-are-they-some-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNCF blog post</a>, where the image below is.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="./k8s-operator.webp" src="/assets/images/k8s-operator-e0798d9d346084f00e21f39668252d9d.webp" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_SS3x"></p><p align="center">*Image credit: CNCF blog*</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="kubernetes-operators-and-the-rise-of-rust">Kubernetes Operators and the Rise of Rust<a href="#kubernetes-operators-and-the-rise-of-rust" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Kubernetes Operators and the Rise of Rust" title="Direct link to Kubernetes Operators and the Rise of Rust">​</a></h2><p>Because Kubernetes itself is written in Go, the majority of Kubernetes operators available today are also written in Go. The <a href="https://book.kubebuilder.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kubebuilder</a> project simplifies the process of building Kubernetes operators in Go and is widely considered the de facto standard for doing so.</p><p>With the increasing popularity of Rust, it was only a matter of time before someone developed a framework for building Kubernetes operators in Rust. The <a href="https://github.com/kube-rs/kube" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kube-rs</a> project allows developers to build Rust-based Kubernetes operators in a similar manner to the <code>kubebuilder</code> project. This project excited us for a few reasons:</p><ol><li>We were interested in learning Rust.</li><li>We wanted to explore whether Rust could be a viable alternative to Go for writing Kubernetes operators.</li><li>We were inspired by the success of companies like <a href="https://github.com/stackabletech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stackable</a>, who have developed numerous Kubernetes operators in Rust.</li></ol><p>This excitement led us to the decision to write our Kubernetes operator in Rust.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="building-the-tembo-operator">Building the Tembo Operator<a href="#building-the-tembo-operator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building the Tembo Operator" title="Direct link to Building the Tembo Operator">​</a></h2><p>Tembo Cloud distinguishes itself from other managed Postgres offerings in several ways, one of which is the ability to install and enable Postgres extensions on the fly. This experience is in part powered by <a href="https://pgt.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trunk</a>, a Postgres extension registry and companion CLI that provide a simplified extension management experience.</p><p>It also introduces the concept of <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/tembo-stacks-intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stacks</a>, which are pre-built use-case-specific Postgres deployments which are optimized and tuned to serve a specific workload.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="roll-your-own">Roll Your Own<a href="#roll-your-own" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Roll Your Own" title="Direct link to Roll Your Own">​</a></h3><p>In order to build these unique capabilities, we knew we’d need to harness the power and flexibility of a Kubernetes operator in our own way. Although there are several Kubernetes operators for Postgres available, none of them offer the same unique Postgres extension management experience or the concept of Stacks.</p><p>Initially, we attempted to build our own operator from scratch. We had successfully built the extension management piece, but soon realized that we were duplicating existing efforts. We had a comprehensive list of baseline features to develop, which included:</p><ul><li>Backup</li><li>Recovery</li><li>Connection Pooling</li><li>Failover</li><li>Upgrades</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="cnpg-to-the-rescue">CNPG to the Rescue<a href="#cnpg-to-the-rescue" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to CNPG to the Rescue" title="Direct link to CNPG to the Rescue">​</a></h3><p>Enter <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloudNativePG</a> (CNPG). CNPG is a Kubernetes operator for Postgres created by the folks at EDB. We found it to be the most compelling of the many Kubernetes operators for Postgres out there. It provided many of the features we needed, including backup, recovery, connection pooling, failover, and upgrades. However, we still needed the ability to install and enable any Postgres extensions on the fly and define Stacks.</p><p>This is where the Tembo Operator comes in. We built the Tembo Operator in a way that utilizes CNPG, which enables us to offer a distinctive management experience for Postgres extensions and Stacks while utilizing a reliable and stable Postgres solution.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="using-the-tembo-operator">Using the Tembo Operator<a href="#using-the-tembo-operator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Using the Tembo Operator" title="Direct link to Using the Tembo Operator">​</a></h2><p>Let’s take a look at what a custom resource spec looks like for the Tembo Operator. Here’s an example for our Machine Learning Stack. We can see this sample spec makes use of our Machine Learning Stack and includes a handful of extensions. Keep in mind, these extensions are installed at runtime with Trunk and are not built into the container image.</p><div class="language-yaml codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block"

Alexander, welcome to the show.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000024---alexander"><em>[00:00:24]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#000024---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000024---alexander" title="Direct link to 000024---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Hello, thank you very much for inviting me.

Maybe I'd like to start by having you give us a quick background, like where did you grow up and what were you doing before you started working on Postgres?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000041---alexander"><em>[00:00:41]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#000041---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000041---alexander" title="Direct link to 000041---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Even before Postgres?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000043---ry"><em>[00:00:43]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000043---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000043---ry" title="Direct link to 000043---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, way back. Were you only like ten years old then?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000049---alexander"><em>[00:00:49]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#000049---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000049---alexander" title="Direct link to 000049---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Yes, I started actually from web development. Yes. And for web development, Postgres become my favorite database management system. That time there were basically two popular open source database management system, MySQL and Postgres. And Postgres behavior looked way more consistent for me. And this is why Postgres become my favorite. And also thing which attracts my attention was generalized indexing in Postgres that Postgres have even that time had GiST and gene indexes which you could apply to different data types, different search operators. And that was very interesting for me. And I also have studied for PhD in university and I was interested in fuzzy search and features like this. And in Postgres I found fuzzystrmatch complete model. And that model contained Levenshtein function which defines editing distance between two strings, number of editing operations. And I found that it doesn't work with multibyte encoding, with multibyte encoding. So it just compares two strings, byte per byte. And my first patch was to just fix this bug. I actually didn't know if I could produce the I just downloaded sources. Thankfully that time compiling a Postgres already wasn't a problem. So I just had Linux on my desktop and just cloned it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000308---alexander"><em>[00:03:08]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#000308---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000308---alexander" title="Direct link to 000308---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Probably that time it was CVS repository, I cloned it and it wasn't difficult to locate the place in the source code responsible for this function. And I just have to find which functions are responsible for getting lengths of multi byte string in Postgres and stuff. Work was very easy, and I have submitted my first patch to Postgres, but then Robert Haas picked my patch to work on it to review and commit. And that time I get that it's not so easy this process community, because we have quite long thread studying possible performance regressions and on, and I rewrote patch this small patch many times. But finally we find a way when this patch not only fixes the problem of multibyte encoding, but also doesn't produce noticeable overhead when it's single byte encoding or strings, just uses single byte characters. In both of these cases, the overhead was negligible. And then Robert did commit my patch.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000440---ry"><em>[00:04:40]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000440---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000440---ry" title="Direct link to 000440---ry">​</a></h5><p>That's amazing. Yeah, it's interesting. How many lines of code was the patch, I wonder?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000446---alexander"><em>[00:04:46]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#000446---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000446---alexander" title="Direct link to 000446---alexander">​</a></h5><p>I don't remember exactly. You could find it on the list, but this patch should be in dozens of lights, probably 20 or something like this, really small. But also with these fix, I started to work on improving this function, improving the performance because if you use the Levenshtein function you are typically looking for strings which are close to your string. Right. And the thing is you basically don't care about large distances. For instance, you are looking for strings with editing distance three or less. And that means that if it would be four you don't care how much bigger is that distance. And if you need only this, then you could easily, not easily, but you could significantly accelerate function Levenshtein calculation in many times and this functionality took even more work for me and Robert. But you could use it, it's Levenshtein less equal. Nice function.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000609---ry"><em>[00:06:09]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000609---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000609---ry" title="Direct link to 000609---ry">​</a></h5><p>That's great. Yeah. I also came to Postgres from being a web developer prior and I've realized in recent weeks actually, that the reason why I went to Postgres and not MySQL is primarily I was using Ruby on Rails, which just kind of was Postgres first and then I really didn't like PHP. Hopefully you weren't a PHP developer, but the lamp stack had MySQL and PHP together and I always just like I don't want to go anywhere near anything near PHP. That's really not a great reason, but it's just a fact.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000648---alexander"><em>[00:06:48]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#000648---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000648---alexander" title="Direct link to 000648---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Yes, probably one of the great feature I have discovered in podcast in early days was DDL transactions. So that if you need to do a database schema migration, you can wrap all the changes into transaction and if something go wrong you can roll. Yes, that's just amazing. And it's interesting that even old and mature database management systems like Oracle or MSS SQL Server lacks of this functionality. I'm not sure about the present day, but at time indefinitely they all were lacking and this was very useful.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000736---ry"><em>[00:07:36]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000736---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000736---ry" title="Direct link to 000736---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's great. So you built obviously you started with that first patch and worked on other fuzzy search stuff. Have you worked on any Postgres extensions?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000752---alexander"><em>[00:07:52]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#000752---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000752---alexander" title="Direct link to 000752---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Yes, I continued to work on Postgres. Then I have found that I get known with Oleg and Theodore who was in Russian contributors of Postgres and I get familiar with their work. Some of their work I already know Gist and Jin. But for others work, it was interesting for me that we could accelerate also search for like patterns. Not just perfect patterns, but imagine you looking something that could be in the middle of the string. And there were that time Pgtrgm module. But at that time it only supports trigram similarity. Search using indexes. But I found that it's pretty easy if you decompose string with trigrams it's pretty easy to implement like search. So you could just extract trigrams from the like patterns and search for them. And thanks that trigrams are extracted all over the string so you can find this substring anywhere. And that time I would say my feeling was just great. So it's just amazing. So with quite small patch you could teach database server with some amazing advanced functionality and I get even more encouragement when I would be sorry if I confusing with names hugh Bert I don't know the guy from blogger from Poland who was posting to the planet PostgresQL waiting for and he also posted waiting for this feature like Word for Pgtrm.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001015---alexander"><em>[00:10:15]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#001015---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001015---alexander" title="Direct link to 001015---alexander">​</a></h5><p>This was one of my first patches. Another thing that during my PhD research I also researched split algorithms for R3 and I have found more advanced algorithm and I have pushed this algorithm to Postgres core and to PostGIS that took time. Yes, because communities are quite conservatives, but it was also good.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001100---ry"><em>[00:11:00]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001100---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001100---ry" title="Direct link to 001100---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, great. Well, I want to talk about OrioleDB, but before we do that, I was thinking are you paying attention to the whole vector search since you spent so much time on Postgres search features or I don't know, at least sometime. I'm curious, are you kind of tracking what's going on with vector search?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001120---alexander"><em>[00:11:20]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#001120---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001120---alexander" title="Direct link to 001120---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Yes. That's interesting. That's an interesting subject. Yes. While I have researched the split algorithms, I have also experimented with cube concrete model which supported basically multidimensional rectangles of different number of dimensions up to one dimensions. And what I have found is that if you have low dimensionality two, three, four or five, then when you are producing split, your split will be good for one dimension, but almost don't differentiate other dimension. So you can imagine this if you have two dimensional space filled with points and you need to split them into two rectangles, there is just two good way to do this split vertically or horizontally. All other ways your rectangles would have a huge overlap. But thing changes when your dimensionality increases. There is a so called Woodman quadratic split algorithm and this algorithm actually do clustering. So it just tries to find to divide the set of points into two clusters. And it doesn't work well for low dimensionality, but for high dimensionality of space it becomes better than if you just pick one axis and split in this dimension. And that was interesting for me and I got familiar with cures of dimensions so that if you have low dimensionality space, you can have some guaranteed and quite good search performance.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001336---alexander"><em>[00:13:36]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#001336---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001336---alexander" title="Direct link to 001336---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Right? So imagine the best example is unidimensional space. You can index this just b three and you have some guaranteed or logarithm n time for search for point request. Right? But when you have high dimensionality, that becomes a problem and uniform random data, which could be good, which you could handle very well with low dimensionality, in high dimensionality it becomes almost unindexable. So if you have 1000 of dimension vectors and you need to search for a similarity, then search in uniform data would be almost impossible to accelerate because you can't identify which particular dimension could give you a match. You could just eat just cumulative results of cumulative results of all dimensions and it's almost impossible to accelerate. I have participated a bit in improvement of PG vector and with some developers of Supabase, we really found that indexing methods, if they applied to uniform data, then they give nothing. So indexing methods, when you have a lot of dimensions, they based on some clustering. The idea is to find, how to say, find the low in the distribution, ununiformity of distribution, and then exploit it. And this is how indexing works. There are different interesting methods for indexing multidimensional space, but I think the favorite is Hnsv method.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001605---alexander"><em>[00:16:05]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#001605---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001605---alexander" title="Direct link to 001605---alexander">​</a></h5><p>And I have read about this method in the scientific paper way before this AI Hype ten years ago. And that was interesting how far these methods from all others. So it's very self.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001626---ry"><em>[00:16:26]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001626---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001626---ry" title="Direct link to 001626---ry">​</a></h5><p>It seems like just vector search is just on the exact edge of search. And the LLM AI, like you said, it's kind of blending both sides. Well, that's cool. So I wanted to obviously chat about OrioleDB, I imagine. Are you spending trying to spend 100% of your time on OrioleDB, or? It's probably hard to I mean, it sounds like there's lots of great things happening in Postgres to distract you from your own work.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001657---alexander"><em>[00:16:57]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#001657---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001657---alexander" title="Direct link to 001657---alexander">​</a></h5><p>The thing vector search definitely distract me. And with this AI Hype, it's hard to not be yeah, yeah, I know.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001706---ry"><em>[00:17:06]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001706---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001706---ry" title="Direct link to 001706---ry">​</a></h5><p>For say, I would just love to kind of have the top three or four things you're trying to accomplish with Oriole maybe and maybe give us a progress report.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001720---alexander"><em>[00:17:20]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#001720---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001720---alexander" title="Direct link to 001720---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Yes. But before this, I'd like to mention about how I use AI in my work.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001726---ry"><em>[00:17:26]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001726---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001726---ry" title="Direct link to 001726---ry">​</a></h5><p>Oh, yeah, sure.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001727---alexander"><em>[00:17:27]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#001727---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001727---alexander" title="Direct link to 001727---alexander">​</a></h5><p>So I have written the blog post, no more vacuum, no more bloat. You may be aware it was on top of news and interesting that I have mostly generated this with Chat GPT. So I just wrote the short item list and asked Chat GPT to write me a blog post. Then I have corrected a little bit, then I wrote some graph, then add some graph, asked Chet GPT to add another paragraph with them, and then it was done. And I was curious that I expected that I would be revealed and blamed for this. But actually the comments I get was, oh, this blog post is so much well written.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001823---ry"><em>[00:18:23]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001823---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001823---ry" title="Direct link to 001823---ry">​</a></h5><p>I know, it's funny. I agree with you. I'll take just like, notes. Like, for example, here I've got like a list of 20 questions that I'm trying to ask you during this interview, possibly ask you. I guarantee you if I sent this list of 20 questions to ChatGPT and say, hey, make these questions better, it would crush it, give me all kinds of much better questions. But anyway, yeah, I agree. People who aren't using it are really missing out on a great assistant. All right, so back to Oriole. What are the top three or four.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001902---alexander"><em>[00:19:02]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#001902---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001902---alexander" title="Direct link to 001902---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Things I'd like to first say about the thing which bring me to the Oriole? When I have studied Postgres, it was just like a magic how MVCC works. So you can run multiple sessions in parallel and each session will have its own snapshot of the data and that was just amazing. And I was very interested what is under the hood, but how this works from user size was perfect, but I always wondered how it implemented internally. Because when you in progress, when you're doing an update, then you just have to mark old tuple and insert the new tuple in the heap. And if hot update is not applied, then you also have to insert all the index tuples even if index set values are not updated. And I wondered if we could do this better. And I think I have this background thoughts for years. So I have studied how MVCC implemented in MySQL as and then how it's implemented in Oracle. And it was very interesting for me to get how it's implemented in Oracle because I heard that Oracle have block level undo. Yes, and then I have thought how could it be on a block level?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002054---alexander"><em>[00:20:54]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#002054---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002054---alexander" title="Direct link to 002054---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Because if two transaction modifies the same tree page and this page got splitted and then one of transaction could be rolled back, then it's not linear list of log records which you could just apply one after another. Because if you need to roll back some change which was before the page split, you need to do some adjustments with it. And then I understood that I need to go deeper and get how it works and then I learn more things, how rider had log working and so on. And I think in 2017 I have started to work on design of my own storage which could work around the most of shortcomings, which I see in Postgres engine. For sure there is no plain wins, in some situation this engine works worse. But I would just like to design some new trade off which could be better in the typical situation. And I can highlight some things in OrioleDB. So the first thing which it is fighting is bloat and in order to eliminate bloat, it has undo log. So if you update a row, then you just have to add a new version of row into the undo chain and you only need to update indexes if their values are updated.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002303---alexander"><em>[00:23:03]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#002303---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002303---alexander" title="Direct link to 002303---alexander">​</a></h5><p>And also indexes are versioned trees as well. In OrioleDB I have heard that it is so in Oracle and I found that this is very attractive idea. Thanks to that index only scan becomes very simple because your secondary index already contains all the information and you doesn't need to look into any secondary structures. Because I have heard that in Postgres index only scans, index only scans is amazing until you run in some problem because if you have some intensive workloads and so on, you might have significant part of visibility map zero it and your query could get into trouble. Yes, that also could happen. And this is why I found that if secondary index version that's attractive idea and OrioleDB have a mixed underlock containing both row level and block level records and block level records allows to handle some changes like eliminating of dead tuples of the page. So for instance, your page contains some tuples which are deleted but still visible for some transaction. And using block level undo lock you can issue a new version of this page and get rid of all dead rows and reclaim their space. But the transactions which need old version can traverse page level underlock and find the tops that they need and another to eliminate bloat is automatic page merging.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002512---alexander"><em>[00:25:12]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#002512---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002512---alexander" title="Direct link to 002512---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Anyway, if even you have undo lock it could happen that your workload is so that you have a lot of sparse pages so you have a lot of data inserted but then the data was deleted and AudioDB supports automatic merge of sparse page to eliminate bloat. Okay, and you had some questions.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002534---ry"><em>[00:25:34]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002534---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002534---ry" title="Direct link to 002534---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I was just remembering that it was a blog post or a presentation where you like here are the ten worst things about Postgres. I don't know the exact phrasing you chose but yeah, basically here are ten problems with Postgres.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002552---alexander"><em>[00:25:52]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#002552---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002552---alexander" title="Direct link to 002552---alexander">​</a></h5><p>That was a blog post of Rick Branson, I hope I spelled the name correctly and yes, I found that was a quite popular blog post. The first popular blog post is definitely Uber blog post about why they moved from Postgres to MySQL. But this blog post from Rick was very interesting for me because the issues he highlighted was very good fit to my vision and to things which I'm going to improve with OrioleDB.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002636---ry"><em>[00:26:36]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002636---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002636---ry" title="Direct link to 002636---ry">​</a></h5><p>You'll probably never be done with OrioleDB because products are never finished, but how's your progress been through your target initial list of things you wanted to accomplish with Oriole are you making good progress through that or give us a progress report.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002653---alexander"><em>[00:26:53]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#002653---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002653---alexander" title="Direct link to 002653---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Yes, I'm making a good progress but currently the main target is not to add new features or handle more things, the current target is stability to get more users. So it doesn't work to have amazing products if nobody uses. And I would say that Database World is quite conservative because obviously people don't want to lose their data. And this is why, before using some new database technology, you need to ensure that it's really stable and mature. And this is the main challenge for new database management system or new storage engine and especially when it's OLTP and OrioleDB currently mainly targets OLTP because OLTP is typically the source of your data, right? So where your business operation happened, for instance, OLAP could be not so important. So you pull your data from OLTP system and put to OLAP for analysis and if it will disappear in a OLAP system you can just repeat the procedure but that doesn't work for OLTP which is initial source of the data. So this is the main difficulty I think, but we already did very good work with the team, very good work on eliminating the bugs but we definitely need more better testers.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002846---ry"><em>[00:28:46]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002846---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002846---ry" title="Direct link to 002846---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I mean, it's a big challenge. It's similar for us as well, but you have to create enough differentiation to get people to want to try it. But you can't go so far away from like you're saying the further the distance is from what they consider stable, the riskier it is. But if you're too close to the same thing, there's not enough value to do the switch.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002912---alexander"><em>[00:29:12]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#002912---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002912---alexander" title="Direct link to 002912---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Right.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002912---ry"><em>[00:29:12]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002912---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002912---ry" title="Direct link to 002912---ry">​</a></h5><p>So it's a tricky catch 22 that you have to do something a little bit dangerous to get the attention.

So there is no strict procedure you can go through and say, okay, your product now should be better, or your product now should be generally available. You just need to decide for yourself and make this decision weighing all the risks.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003030---ry"><em>[00:30:30]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003030---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003030---ry" title="Direct link to 003030---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it was funny. I'll tell you a quick story about that. With my previous company, Astronomer, we were 0.1, 0.2, 0.3. I think we got to like 0.17. And it was like there was nothing big happening in any release that would cause us to say, oh, this should be the 1.0. And then we are also thinking like, this is one of me thinking this, because I was like, let's just make the next one 1.0, goddamn it, but let's save the 1.0 for a big marketing push. I don't know that they ever did it. We waited so long that we never had a 1.0 of that platform. By the time we got to it was like, oh, let's rewrite it. I think it's a tricky thing to ship, but I'm a big fan of shipping early and often. And just mark your thing as an RC candidate. It doesn't matter. It will attract more attention with that RC dot. That zero dot.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003135---alexander"><em>[00:31:35]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#003135---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003135---alexander" title="Direct link to 003135---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Yes. Actually, the number in the version is marketing you can find in the shop. The price for the good could be $20. But you go away, you come back, and now it's $30 crossed $25.01 of advices. I heard about version numbering was never number. If you have new products, never number your version 1.0.0, nobody will trust it's stable. So you should number something like 1.3 point eleven.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003221---ry"><em>[00:32:21]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003221---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003221---ry" title="Direct link to 003221---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, I'm kind of a big fan of CalVer, where the version of your software should be like, how many releases? It's 23 dot whatever.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003235---alexander"><em>[00:32:35]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#003235---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003235---alexander" title="Direct link to 003235---alexander">​</a></h5><ol start="2023"><li></li></ol><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003235---ry"><em>[00:32:35]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003235---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003235---ry" title="Direct link to 003235---ry">​</a></h5><p>And here's our 6th release in 2023. And that kind of gets rid of all of the traditional semver stuff. But again, that's kind of hard to do as well. Well, I had a bunch of extra little questions I want to ask you just to get to know you a little better. But if you had a magic wand that you could add any feature to Postgres and tomorrow morning we wake up and it's there, what would it be? What's the most important thing? Or would you be most excited to see?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003306---alexander"><em>[00:33:06]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#003306---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003306---alexander" title="Direct link to 003306---alexander">​</a></h5><p>My question...it could sound probably selfish, but I have a patch set to improve Postgres table access method API. This patch set definitely needs some work and if I magic went I would like this work to be just done and everything is perfect and in the Postgres core perfected. And that would make OrioleDB become a pure extension. But not only that, I think it could clear the path for more table access method implementations.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003348---ry"><em>[00:33:48]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003348---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003348---ry" title="Direct link to 003348---ry">​</a></h5><p>Got it. That's good, that's a great one.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003350---alexander"><em>[00:33:50]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#003350---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003350---alexander" title="Direct link to 003350---alexander">​</a></h5><p>And one thing if you have a few minutes, the Postgres Extensibility is probably the idea which comes from Postgres early design and remains Postgres differentiation feature till now. Because all our ideas from Postgres design today it sounds weird and it's not.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003419---ry"><em>[00:34:19]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003419---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003419---ry" title="Direct link to 003419---ry">​</a></h5><p>There, but Extensibility is it's it's honestly, I always just thought MySQL and Postgres were just two different. Yeah, I didn't realize how much more Extensible Postgres at least tries to be and has been and how many extensions exist for it. Once you start looking at that list, it's pretty amazing, all the work that people have done to extend it. Is there anything, would you say about Postgres that almost nobody agrees with you about? Do you have an opinion that's controversial or just it's hard for people to agree with you about?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003503---alexander"><em>[00:35:03]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#003503---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003503---alexander" title="Direct link to 003503---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Probably I don't know this opinion. So there are opinions where we have disagreement in community, but I can't remember the opinion which leaves me alone with that. So probably not. Yeah, there are opinions where I appear in a minority, but not more.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003528---ry"><em>[00:35:28]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003528---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003528---ry" title="Direct link to 003528---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, a lot of times that's just because you don't understand everything yet, right? People come in with a hot take and then the mailing list will educate them on other factors.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003540---alexander"><em>[00:35:40]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#003540---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003540---alexander" title="Direct link to 003540---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Yes, there are disagreements because we are writing patches to Postgres and we understand these patches as improvements. But actually there is never a pure win. If you achieve something, you always lose something. That might be not obvious, but I don't know. So if you are adding too many SQL comments and your parser get complicated and parcel state machine cannot fit to processor cache and get slower and your source code also becomes bigger and harder to understand and so on. And finally we are just a group of people which needs to make some decision of will, of where to go. No way is a clear win. We are trying our best to don't discourage existing users, but even the best offers of them, even with best efforts of them. There are some disprovements for sure. At the end of the day, we need to negotiate and make a decision.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003654---ry"><em>[00:36:54]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003654---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003654---ry" title="Direct link to 003654---ry">​</a></h5><p>Where can people find you online? And in particular, what's the best way for them to get involved with testing OrioleDB?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003704---alexander"><em>[00:37:04]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#003704---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003704---alexander" title="Direct link to 003704---alexander">​</a></h5><p>Yes, any person can reach me via email and testing Oriole, you just go to GitHub, download and compile sources or even easier, go to Docker Hub and get the docker image and just go experiment with your data and your workload and raise an issue or discussion and share your experience and.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003732---ry"><em>[00:37:32]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003732---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003732---ry" title="Direct link to 003732---ry">​</a></h5><p>Refresh us one last time. Where are the use cases where Oriole is going to outperform vanilla Postgres most dramatically I guess yes.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003743---alexander"><em>[00:37:43]<!-- --> - Alexander</em><a href="#003743---alexander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003743---alexander" title="Direct link to 003743---alexander">​</a></h5><p>So the situations are when you have a lot of updates, very update intensive workload, then OrioleDB could outperform things to undo log. Another case is huge multi core machines and OrioleDB eliminates a lot of bottlenecks and can perform in times faster and also OrioleDB implements role level write ahead log and if you have a huge write ahead log stream and you need geographical replication, OrioleDB can also help a lot. Awesome.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="003831---ry"><em>[00:38:31]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#003831---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 003831---ry" title="Direct link to 003831---ry">​</a></h5><p>Okay, great.

I'm Ry Walker, founder of Tembo, a managed Postgres company. And today I have Pavlo Golub. Did I say that right? Pavlo? Yeah, you can fix it from Cybertec as my guest. So Pavlo, welcome to the show.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000030---pavlo"><em>[00:00:30]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000030---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000030---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000030---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>Yes, thank you for having me. Hi there.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000032---ry"><em>[00:00:32]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000032---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000032---ry" title="Direct link to 000032---ry">​</a></h5><p>Hi there. Yeah, so maybe you could start by giving us a quick background, like where you grew up and what were you doing before you started working on Postgres.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000041---pavlo"><em>[00:00:41]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000041---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000041---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000041---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>Okay, so I was born in Soviet Union so I'm a little bit old, but yeah, I lived in Ukraine. And the first time I saw Postgres, when I was in my high school, it was like fourth year of high school and at that time it wasn't very popular. Everybody we're talking about MySQL like the only database with open source and yeah, at that time I saw the PostgresQL, I tried to install it and run it. It was hard for me to do that because at that time the version was like 7.4 something and at that time there was no installer for Windows and we were mostly like Windows guys at that times. So, yeah, I need to install Linux and then install Postgres. Yeah, I managed to do that, but I wasn't happy about it. The whole process is like I feel like cumbersome or something like that. So I left it for like a couple of years and then my first job in IT I was a support guy, so it was directly connected with the Postgres. So I started my IT career with Postgres and I'm happy that I had this chance.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000236---ry"><em>[00:02:36]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000236---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000236---ry" title="Direct link to 000236---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's crazy. I don't personally remember when I first started using Postgres. I think it could have just been when I started using Ruby on Rails, I don't know. But it's funny, I don't remember when I first used Linux or a lot of things, but it's great that you have that distinct memory. You started in support, you've built some stuff. Now on top of it, tell me about the body of work you've done on Postgres or with Postgres. I'm curious to know what you've built.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000313---pavlo"><em>[00:03:13]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000313---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000313---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000313---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>So right now at Cybertec I'm a consultant, so my position called consultant, they called me consultant, but I prefer to think about myself as a developer. I'm not an Admin, I'm not a DBA, I'm a developer. So I'm mostly doing developing things for Postgres. I had a couple of small patches to these source, but I don't consider them as major things. So I did some client libraries for Delphi if somebody still knows what it is, and later I switched to C, Go, Python, that kind of stuff. And right now I'm mostly develop with the Go language. And at the moment we have a couple of utilities made in Cybertec, so I'm in charge of them. So one of them is like pg_timetable, which is a scheduler for PostgresQL, and another is pg_watch which is a monitoring solution for Postgres.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000430---ry"><em>[00:04:30]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000430---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000430---ry" title="Direct link to 000430---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. Yeah. What caught my attention was pg_timetable because I come from a company that my previous company was Apache Airflow. So the idea of doing dags jobs that are chained off of other jobs, to me, there's no other way. Trying to schedule jobs and hope that they finish by the time of the next one, that's dependent is something that people used to do and they should never, ever do anymore. But I'm sure it still happens. Right. So certainly if people are using pg_cron, no way to chain them, as far as I can see.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000511---pavlo"><em>[00:05:11]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000511---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000511---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000511---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>We had a client and we have a process, like, lasting, like 14, 15 hours consisting of many steps which are dependent in some complicated ways. So we used a make file to split them into the jobs and to specify that this stage must be executed after that. And that and that worked fine. It's cool to have a special utility to run that kind of jobs or chains, whatever.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000556---ry"><em>[00:05:56]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000556---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000556---ry" title="Direct link to 000556---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. Well, one of the things I think about a lot is how Postgres, the Postgres server is doing lots of jobs, right. I don't know how many processes it's dealing with, someone with better internal knowledges, but I know it's certainly vacuuming. It's certainly processing queries. It's doing a lot of things right. And then question is I'm a fan of SRP single responsibility principle and programming in general, but I also like monoliths too. We all have conflicting ideas in our heads. And having a queue managed inside the Postgres, you're kind of like straddling, right? Because you have a container next to it. So some of the work is happening over there, but some of it is inside of Postgres too. Why not have it all be inside? What are you thinking about for future versions of pg_timetable? Why not just do all the work inside of the running Postgres cluster?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000700---pavlo"><em>[00:07:00]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000700---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000700---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000700---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>So, yeah, thank you for the question because that was like, the second thought when we released the pg_timetable. So the idea is that PostgreSQL uses a separate process for everything. If you have a new connection, you need a new process. So if you have a background worker for cron or for another scheduler, you will need a background worker. A separate process. Yeah. It's possible. We can create an extensions with Go. It's possible, yes. But right now, I'm not sure what benefits we will have.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000758---ry"><em>[00:07:58]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000758---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000758---ry" title="Direct link to 000758---ry">​</a></h5><p>It also feels kind of gross, right, to think of throwing it all together. But I have this conversation all the time with my team. If you have a system that's dependent on the Postgres, let's say there's an API, right? And the API, if the Postgres is only invoked when the API happens you could theoretically put all that compute into one bucket and just let the API talk to I'm thinking, like, say, take it's a Rust API. Should you serve that Rust API as a separate container and have the separation of concerns? Or should you just create a custom Postgres extension and let the Rust run inside the Postgres cluster and there's zero latency to the data in that regard, but it's a little bit of a Frankenapp at that point. It's a tricky problem.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000852---pavlo"><em>[00:08:52]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000852---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000852---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000852---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>I will tell you that, that I want to implement this scheduler as an extension for Postgres, not because I think that we will have some benefits, but because this is very interesting task for me as a developer, first of all.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000908---ry"><em>[00:09:08]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000908---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000908---ry" title="Direct link to 000908---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. Is pg_timetable supported by any cloud providers right now?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000916---pavlo"><em>[00:09:16]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000916---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000916---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000916---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, we can run pg_timetable against any cloud provider. If you want, you can run it in Docker and Kubernetes as a standalone binary, or even you can try to grab the source code and put it into this AWS fancy one time run and forget I don't remember how they called it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000946---ry"><em>[00:09:46]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000946---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000946---ry" title="Direct link to 000946---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, but because it has the sidecar, it probably can't be like a standard extension in RDS, for example.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000954---pavlo"><em>[00:09:54]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#000954---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000954---pavlo" title="Direct link to 000954---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>Right, it might be, but I think to make this happen, we need to somehow communicate with AWS and make that happen. It's more like politics, not yeah, well.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001010---ry"><em>[00:10:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001010---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001010---ry" title="Direct link to 001010---ry">​</a></h5><p>I think it's also just like I don't know if any of the other extensions that they offer have a sidecar requirement. Right. So that's one of the things we're thinking about at Tembo is like, let's allow sidecars if you allow sidecars to extensions in our managed service yes. It's like, again, it's a lot more dangerous in the sense that there's more things that could break, but it's also more powerful. And if we had the rule that dangerous things are bad and you wouldn't have a combustible engine inside of a car where little explosions are happening all the time to power it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001050---pavlo"><em>[00:10:50]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001050---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001050---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001050---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>On the other hand, you can build your own image, right, and somehow to limit the binary in it to do some dangerous things, et cetera.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001102---ry"><em>[00:11:02]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001102---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001102---ry" title="Direct link to 001102---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. I joke sometimes and say we're building the dangerous Postgres just because it's not really we support 150 extensions now, so it's like, yeah, our support footprint is increased and scarier than if you had 75, but I still say it's worth it to the developer to have the capability. So I'd love to get pg_timetable as a standard option. I want to use it, basically. What's funny is I'm building a data warehouse right now for our company, and I started with pg_cron, and I have these four jobs that all start at the same time and it's very early, so it's not a problem. But I would love to have them be chained. Like I said, I could do that fake with some spacing things out, but I really feel like I've just stepped back 20 years into the world of early data processing. So I appreciate what you built and use it soon.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001208---pavlo"><em>[00:12:08]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001208---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001208---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001208---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>Okay. Let me know if you're happy with it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001211---ry"><em>[00:12:11]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001211---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001211---ry" title="Direct link to 001211---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think it's a good idea and it could also help developers avoid having to go pick up some other tool to take the next stage of their data processing, which to me is a big win. And we're trying to make the Meme "Postgres for everything." I know you are too, in a sense, because you built the extension. But yeah, I think there's so much it can do, and it can do a lot more than just writing and reading data.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001254---pavlo"><em>[00:12:54]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001254---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001254---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001254---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>One more thing about having the pg_timetable as an external application is that you can use your own binaries inside jobs like baseql or pg_dump or something, like to grab something, to convert something, et cetera. So we want to have a possibility for developers to create their own docker images with the binaries or tools they only need and pg_timetable. So in this way it sounds like a Swiss knife, right? So I need a pg_timetable and a couple of utilities for grabbing something to manipulate with files, et cetera. And then we pack it and that's all. We don't need to think how we should allow the application to install it or to have it on the system version, et cetera, et cetera.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001358---ry"><em>[00:13:58]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001358---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001358---ry" title="Direct link to 001358---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, basically what you're saying is it gets even more dangerous quickly, right? Like the base use case is one thing, but then when people start doing some more wild things, including their own, it could be their own packages, right? Their own, of course, completely custom. Nobody knows what's inside of it. It could be a bitcoin miner, it could be anything, right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001423---pavlo"><em>[00:14:23]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001423---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001423---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001423---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001426---ry"><em>[00:14:26]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001426---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001426---ry" title="Direct link to 001426---ry">​</a></h5><p>Are you working on the next version of it or is it pretty stable right now and doesn't require a lot?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001432---pavlo"><em>[00:14:32]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001432---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001432---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001432---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>So at the moment we are stable. So we are open for ideas and then requests, et cetera. But at the moment we are fine, I believe. So it's like in maintenance mode, so we update versions, packages, et cetera. So no new box. I'm happy with it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001456---ry"><em>[00:14:56]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001456---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001456---ry" title="Direct link to 001456---ry">​</a></h5><p>Did you build it? Was it sort of a small team there or did you kind of build it solo?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001502---pavlo"><em>[00:15:02]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001502---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001502---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001502---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>So the initial idea was by Hans, our CEO, and yeah, that was my first project in Go. So I was trying to learn a new language to see how can I do this? And we are now here. That's cool, I believe.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001536---ry"><em>[00:15:36]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001536---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001536---ry" title="Direct link to 001536---ry">​</a></h5><p>What were the biggest challenges would you say you faced while working, while building it? Was it hard to, for example, understand internals or was that part easy? I'm kind of curious what was toughest.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001549---pavlo"><em>[00:15:49]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001549---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001549---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001549---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>For me, I would say that the new tools that you need to use, like if you are familiar with your favorite IDE and then for Go language, you need to switch to something like Vs code or Go land or whatever. This is completely new tool for you. And you have no this muscular memory for shortcuts, et cetera, et cetera. It's kind of difficult. Like six months I was trying to get used to new tooling, but after that I'm pretty happy.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001626---ry"><em>[00:16:26]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001626---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001626---ry" title="Direct link to 001626---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's so when was it that you started working on timetable? pg_timetable?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001635---pavlo"><em>[00:16:35]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001635---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001635---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001635---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>Maybe three years ago, something like that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001639---ry"><em>[00:16:39]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001639---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001639---ry" title="Direct link to 001639---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. Okay, well, that's great. So have you guys implemented it many times now for customers or how has it been? I know it's not a commercial product, but I assume it should be helping the consulting business, right? Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001658---pavlo"><em>[00:16:58]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001658---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001658---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001658---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>So it usually goes in a package with something. Usually if we have a new client, we are talking about high availability and we are talking about monitoring, and we are talking about that and that, and then we say, okay, we have a scheduler if you want it, and usually people want it. I don't remember we have like a standalone cell for a pg_timetable. But yeah, it's usually like packaged into something bigger, usually with a high availability and monitoring.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001733---ry"><em>[00:17:33]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001733---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001733---ry" title="Direct link to 001733---ry">​</a></h5><p>Got it. It’s like a sweetener, right? Cool. Well, maybe I'll shift into some more general topics. I'd love to know what are some of the developments in Postgres ecosystem that you're excited about?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001750---pavlo"><em>[00:17:50]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001750---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001750---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001750---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>So the Postgres itself, the core, I always want to constantly want to do something for the core, but.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001803---ry"><em>[00:18:03]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001803---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001803---ry" title="Direct link to 001803---ry">​</a></h5><p>It's like you're racking your brain around there.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001807---pavlo"><em>[00:18:07]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001807---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001807---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001807---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>The process itself is not like user friendly. First of all, you need to communicate through the email lists. No GitHub, no issues, no pull requests. And you need constantly update your patches because the development is very active, and you need to defend your patch against many people in the community because why you did it, what purpose, why you do it that way, not another. So that might take some time for.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001846---ry"><em>[00:18:46]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001846---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001846---ry" title="Direct link to 001846---ry">​</a></h5><p>Who are your favorite people in the Postgres ecosystem? You hate to play favorites, but people I should interview get to know anybody come to mind?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001856---pavlo"><em>[00:18:56]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#001856---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001856---pavlo" title="Direct link to 001856---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, a lot of them, frankly speaking. Well, I think that the community is the reason, number one, why I am still doing Postgres things. I was working like, for five years without knowing nobody from the community. And then in 2011, I was first time on the PG conference in Europe, in Amsterdam, and that changed my mind. Absolutely. I saw what the community is and what are the main things and why are those working that way and not another. So if you want names, so Bruce Momjian, for sure. Magnus Hagander, Ilya Kosmodemiansky, Vik Fearing, Andreas Scherbaum, a lot of them. Like Lætitia Avrot . A lot of them.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001959---ry"><em>[00:19:59]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001959---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001959---ry" title="Direct link to 001959---ry">​</a></h5><p>Well, I'll reach out to those people. It's obviously a very big community too, certainly, considering the extent, anyone who's touching it is very excited. First, I'm going to the know, the New York City conference here in a couple of months. Yeah. So I'm excited to meet a bunch of people there. And we went to an event in San Jose last spring, which was fun. All right, so here's another one. If you had a magic wand and you could add any feature to Postgres? What would you change about it or what would you add?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002039---pavlo"><em>[00:20:39]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#002039---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002039---pavlo" title="Direct link to 002039---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>I don't think that I can change something in a way that it will be a brick and change but I would like to see if we can implement Postgres using threads, not the processes. I would like to see if that might be better solution that we have now. I'm not sure.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002104---ry"><em>[00:21:04]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002104---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002104---ry" title="Direct link to 002104---ry">​</a></h5><p>It's being debated, right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002107---pavlo"><em>[00:21:07]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#002107---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002107---pavlo" title="Direct link to 002107---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, absolutely.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002108---ry"><em>[00:21:08]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002108---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002108---ry" title="Direct link to 002108---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, we'll see.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002109---pavlo"><em>[00:21:09]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#002109---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002109---pavlo" title="Direct link to 002109---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>It's a hot topic.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002110---ry"><em>[00:21:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002110---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002110---ry" title="Direct link to 002110---ry">​</a></h5><p>Hot topic, yeah. I did join the mailing list for a short period of time. I'm starting a company too and it just was too much. I was like, oh my gosh, this is a fire hose and someday I want to be able to have the time to consume it. But today wasn't that day. Is there anything about Postgres that no one agrees with you about? Do you have any contrarian views about any part of it that you can think of?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002138---pavlo"><em>[00:21:38]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#002138---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002138---pavlo" title="Direct link to 002138---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, probably my views about the Windows because I was a Windows guy and I'm still a Windows guy and I'm always saying that we need to support Windows as well as we support Linux. So that means installers for Windows and extensions and tools, et cetera, et cetera. And people usually say, no, Linux is fine and that's enough is enough.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002208---ry"><em>[00:22:08]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002208---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002208---ry" title="Direct link to 002208---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it's interesting, it's fun. I'm interested in a lot of different areas of programming. I was looking at, say, Unity, you know, game development and it's C# and I'm like "Ugh" and it seems like very Windows centric and I'm like because I'm a Mac user and whatever. For me it'd be like Mac, Linux, Windows in terms of my priority but I'm like certainly not C#, right? But anyway, yeah, the religious wars will never end there, I guess, in terms of platforms.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002247---pavlo"><em>[00:22:47]<!-- --> - Pavlo</em><a href="#002247---pavlo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002247---pavlo" title="Direct link to 002247---pavlo">​</a></h5><p>The bad thing about our approach right now that I think that we don't have enough good GUI programs for PostgreSQL every time we are using psql to show something to demo. And I think that for newbies it would be much easier to follow a demonstration if you use some fancy GUI application.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002315---ry"><em>[00:23:15]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002315---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002315---ry" title="Direct link to 002315---ry">​</a></h5><p>Well, it was great chatting.

I mean, Eric Ridge is pretty much a household name in mean, in case there's someone listening who doesn't know what you've been working on. You want to give us a quick background on your involvement in postgres over the years?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000036---eric"><em>[00:00:36]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000036---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000036---eric" title="Direct link to 000036---eric">​</a></h5><p>I think a household name is absolutely not true. First of all, I'm Eric. I am the reason that this postgres extension name ZomboDB exists. And over the years of developing that, something that's now called Pgrx kind of fell out of all that work that lets us develop extensions for postgres using the Rust programming language. And these things have been where my interest has been as it relates to postgres. I guess past seven, eight years now. Things ZomboDB has been out since 2015, so we're right at eight years.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000114---ry"><em>[00:01:14]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000114---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000114---ry" title="Direct link to 000114---ry">​</a></h5><p>Do you know how many it's at? An uncountable number of Rust extensions now, probably you probably at one point knew how many there were, but now you've lost track.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000124---eric"><em>[00:01:24]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000124---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000124---eric" title="Direct link to 000124---eric">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's a good question. It's hard to know. There's no real clearinghouse around extensions.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000130---ry"><em>[00:01:30]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000130---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000130---ry" title="Direct link to 000130---ry">​</a></h5><p>If only there was, that would be a great thing for someone to build.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000133---eric"><em>[00:01:33]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000133---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000133---eric" title="Direct link to 000133---eric">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it would. I wish somebody would get on that. Right. Yeah, that's a good question. There's some bigger names using Pgrx, and the TimescaleDB is one. Supabase is one. We recently released plrust, and that's found its way out on RDS. So that's exciting for us. What we see popping up are small extensions that are written in Pgrx, and we see a lot of people writing I don't want to call them one off extensions, but one off extensions that are just, like, specific to their business use case and solve some interesting data domain problem that only they would have. But now they have the ability to build that business logic or data manipulation or what have you into their database and into the database itself.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000227---ry"><em>[00:02:27]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000227---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000227---ry" title="Direct link to 000227---ry">​</a></h5><p>Without having to go find a C programmer that's willing to do such work. Right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000231---eric"><em>[00:02:31]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000231---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000231---eric" title="Direct link to 000231---eric">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. And that was one of the motivators for developing Pgrx, was I guess I had been working on postgres extensions in some form or fashion since postgres 8.0, and I think that was even before the extension packaging and create extension command and all that came into existence not long before. But I think that that was before and yeah, I mean, just over the years, I got tired of working in C. When you're developing a postgres extension in C, you're not only putting on your C programmer hat, but you're trying to put on the hat of a postgres hacker. Right. You need to understand postgres sources just as much as you do the language itself. So Rust was becoming a popular a number of years ago. So I was like, you know what, I'm going to try to do this.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000322---ry"><em>[00:03:22]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000322---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000322---ry" title="Direct link to 000322---ry">​</a></h5><p>Well, it's interesting. It's like how a lot of games, if they have mods, the language for the mods has to be easier than the language for the core game. Right. So a game might be written in something like Unity, but then they give you, like, Lua as a tool or JavaScript or something simple to build. But in Postgres, that wasn't true. Now, is Rust as simple as Lua or JavaScript? Maybe not, but it's still like very beloved people who try to learn it. In my experience so far, it's 100% like anyone who tries to learn Rust learns it and loves it. I haven't found someone yet and I have a small sample size, but, yeah, seems like it's a pretty good hit rate in terms of the perfect mix of control and speed with the ease of onboarding.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000410---eric"><em>[00:04:10]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000410---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000410---eric" title="Direct link to 000410---eric">​</a></h5><p>If you're not a C programmer, then writing the postgres extension in C is going to be difficult again, because C and then also because you're really programming Postgres's version of C, which is great, but it's not JavaScript, it's not Ruby, it's not Java. If you're not a Rust programmer, first you've got to learn Rust, and Rust is different enough from all the other languages to make that a point. But what we're trying to do with Pgrx, and it's going to be a multi year effort to do this, it may never get done, but we're trying to present the postgres internals in the most idiomatic way possible to Rust. Right. So that if you are a Rust programmer or you are beginning to learn Rust, it'll be pretty obvious what you need to do in order to make your postgres extension useful.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000510---ry"><em>[00:05:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000510---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000510---ry" title="Direct link to 000510---ry">​</a></h5><p>So you said you were working on extensions as early as Postgres Eight. Were you a Postgres user or our developer even earlier than that, or was that sort of when you got involved?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000521---eric"><em>[00:05:21]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000521---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000521---eric" title="Direct link to 000521---eric">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, Postgres user, I think we started using Postgres at work in the year 2000 and that might have been I mean, is that 7.1, 7.2? It's quite a long time ago and we've been using it every day since. And, yeah, somewhere along the way we needed to do some work inside the database. So here we are today.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000546---ry"><em>[00:05:46]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000546---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000546---ry" title="Direct link to 000546---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. For me, when I think about when did I start using Postgres, it's like thinking about when did I first start using a laptop, it's like I don't remember exactly when, but definitely transitioned to having a laptop at some point. But, yeah, it didn't seem monumental to start using Postgres back then, but obviously it's come a long way and it's a pretty exciting ecosystem right now. So, yeah. What do you think the most powerful thing about extensions are? Do you have any thoughts on what are the most powerful things you can do with extensions, out of curiosity?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000619---eric"><em>[00:06:19]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000619---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000619---eric" title="Direct link to 000619---eric">​</a></h5><p>It's an interesting question.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000621---ry"><em>[00:06:21]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000621---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000621---ry" title="Direct link to 000621---ry">​</a></h5><p>What's the coolest part of, I guess what API? Or maybe another good question is what hasn't been exposed yet that should be or needs to be in Pgrx? That would be powerful.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000632---eric"><em>[00:06:32]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000632---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000632---eric" title="Direct link to 000632---eric">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I'll start there and then work backwards. There's a lot of internal APIs within Postgres, and there's a number of interesting ones. There's the index access method API, which is really easy to implement. We haven't added safe wrappers around that to Pgrx, but it's real easy to implement. It's really just a handful of functions. There's the Foreign Data Wrapper API, which Supabase released a project that they call Wrappers that'll let you create foreign data wrappers using Rust backed up by Pgrx. So kind of the next big API around that genre of internals. There would be the Table Access Method APIs, and we haven't exposed these at all yet. They're actually difficult to get at even through our bindings just because of the way they're set up in the postgres sources. So when we get around to doing that, and I hope that we will, there's going to be some development effort on our part to safely expose these or safely expose the Table Access Method APIs. But that's the API that would let you write your own heap storage engineer system in Rust.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000749---ry"><em>[00:07:49]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000749---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000749---ry" title="Direct link to 000749---ry">​</a></h5><p>Tell me about I mean, probably not everybody knows what ZomboDB is. Maybe quickly describe what it does and what it doesn't do and what's coming next with it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000759---eric"><em>[00:07:59]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000759---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000759---eric" title="Direct link to 000759---eric">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it's the worst named software product.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000803---ry"><em>[00:08:03]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000803---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000803---ry" title="Direct link to 000803---ry">​</a></h5><p>First off, why'd you call it Zombo, everyone wants to know.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000806---eric"><em>[00:08:06]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000806---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000806---eric" title="Direct link to 000806---eric">​</a></h5><p>I think, Ry, you're old enough to remember Zombo.com. If you don't remember it, then that just means you weren't playing on the internet. You're probably doing real work. It still exists so listeners can go and check it out, but the name just came from that. So ZomboDB is a postgres extension, and it's been through numerous iterations over the past eight years, but it has always been postgres extension that lets you create an index on a table that's backed by Elasticsearch. Typically the usage pattern is you create the index indexing all of the columns in the table and you point it to an Elasticsearch endpoint over Http or Https, and the ZomboDB keeps that index up to date. It keeps the index MVCC correct. All of your search results are you only see results that would otherwise be visible within the executing transaction has its own query language for doing full text queries, so users don't have to learn the Elasticsearch query DSL, which is pretty intense.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000914---ry"><em>[00:09:14]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000914---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000914---ry" title="Direct link to 000914---ry">​</a></h5><p>Can you use the Elasticsearch DSL with it, though?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000917---eric"><em>[00:09:17]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#000917---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000917---eric" title="Direct link to 000917---eric">​</a></h5><p>You can, and there's a number of ways to do that. The query language itself allows you to just insert as part of an expression. You can insert a JSON block to represent a query DSL node. There's a full set of SQL builder functions, so you can build query DSL through SQL statements. You can mix and match these things together. It's pretty sophisticated on that front, and it also exposes nearly all of Elasticsearch's aggregate endpoints to enable you to do really interesting aggregations with your full text. And since all the fields of a table are also stored in the Elasticsearch index, you can do some really interesting things that involve full text queries and aggregating on various metadata fields and do all this with a large distributed elastic search cluster behind the scenes and do it in near real time. It's really slick. The downside to ZomboDB is that you now have an Elastic search cluster running alongside your postgres cluster. And ES is a living breathing system. It requires significant attention and maintenance in production. It gives you a lot of capabilities to scale out horizontally very easily, but it is its own living breathing system there.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001042---ry"><em>[00:10:42]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001042---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001042---ry" title="Direct link to 001042---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it'd be great if you can build a version of this without requiring elastic.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001046---eric"><em>[00:10:46]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#001046---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001046---eric" title="Direct link to 001046---eric">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I know a guy that's working on that.

Once we kind of got ZomboDB working, we were like, whoa, it's really amazing what you can do with this and how easy it is to use. And one of the mantras from Zombo.com is the only limit is yourself. And ZomboDB really kind of makes it feel that way because it makes querying your data, especially real dense text data, just super simple.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001126---ry"><em>[00:11:26]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001126---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001126---ry" title="Direct link to 001126---ry">​</a></h5><p>And so you use Zombo pretty aggressively within TCDI, which is where you work, right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001133---eric"><em>[00:11:33]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#001133---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001133---eric" title="Direct link to 001133---eric">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, TCDI is my employer. Yeah. We've had Zombo in production since 2013 and we didn't open source until 2015.

The power that I know, you guys, it's like legal documents. I might get it wrong, but like searching legal documents to some degree, right? Is it a competitive advantage for the business? The fact that Zombo is inside, would you say?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001208---eric"><em>[00:12:08]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#001208---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001208---eric" title="Direct link to 001208---eric">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, absolutely. Our industry is ediscovery litigation support and among many other areas within that domain, searching large volumes of text is a key thing. And we're the only player in our industry that has text search capabilities to the degree that we do. And I'm not going to go name or other competitors or anything, but their abilities to do complicated text search that involves fuzzy queries plus regular expressions, plus boolean expressions, plus long tail proximity queries hit highlighting it's our abilities to do that just far exceed our competitors because of ZomboDB, because of postgres, and because of Elasticsearch.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001255---ry"><em>[00:12:55]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001255---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001255---ry" title="Direct link to 001255---ry">​</a></h5><p>Do you use the extension in both transactional use cases as well as analytical? Or is it mostly just powering the search bar inside the product or is there some back end?

I guess, to our users. Users, it's much more than just a search box. They can search by particular fields and design proximity queries, and they can do term lookups. They can create real time dashboards and whatnot through our software. That's all backed by ZomboDB. One interesting use case is in the world of litigation. The plaintiffs will provide the defendants with a list of keywords that need to be searched in order to find documents that are responsive to particular to these topics. And these keywords are sometimes just literally a keyword one word. Sometimes they're phrases, sometimes they're wild card terms. Sometimes they're phrases with embedded wildcards. Sometimes they're patterns that need to be recognized. And so, like an analytics side of what we use ZomboDB for is taking these ginormous lists of things and kicking it off and getting back a list of the 6 million documents out of the 200 million that might match this set of keywords that the plaintiffs have requested production for.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001425---ry"><em>[00:14:25]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001425---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001425---ry" title="Direct link to 001425---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's intense.

I think of it as kind of like the gold standard of what a postgres extension ought to look like. ZomboDB does integrate with it, but the data world that I live in doesn't involve the need to do geographical type queries. But I've always been really impressed with it. I think the postgres foreign data wrapper as an extension is really great, and that comes from the core community, but pretty impressed with that. Citus has always been interesting to me. I guess they've long since been bought out by Microsoft and are still going strong. I think that Citus really shows off the power of what a postgres extension can do, and it also shows off the power of having committers on the hackers and hackers to be able to help move the extension system in postgres forward so that you can then implement something like Citus on top of it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001536---ry"><em>[00:15:36]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001536---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001536---ry" title="Direct link to 001536---ry">​</a></h5><p>When they were building that, did they have to add things to extensions in order to build that?

I see things like somebody just needed to talk to an S3 bucket, and so they put together a little Pgrx extension to do that. Little things like that are what get me excited about Postgres extensions.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001626---ry"><em>[00:16:26]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001626---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001626---ry" title="Direct link to 001626---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it's pretty timely. I have a co-op that started literally today. Shout out to Jay and I told him to build a clerk FDW using the Supabase Wrappers SDK. And he's like, what the hell do you say to me? Just try read the docs, we'll see where it goes. But I'll report back how that goes. But yeah, Clerk, we're using Clerk for Auth for our company, and I just need a simple read access to three collections. So I figure he should be able to get it done by the end of the day, but I might be pushing too hard.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001700---eric"><em>[00:17:00]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#001700---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001700---eric" title="Direct link to 001700---eric">​</a></h5><p>Well, it's possible. And that's a great example of where having a simple framework for making an extension is really powerful. Right. I mean, once you figure out the documentation and how to tie the two things together, it probably is just an afternoon's worth of work. And now you've got something that solves a problem and you can move on.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001721---ry"><em>[00:17:21]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001721---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001721---ry" title="Direct link to 001721---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I figure his second one maybe will take an afternoon, first one might take a few days, but we'll see.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001726---eric"><em>[00:17:26]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#001726---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001726---eric" title="Direct link to 001726---eric">​</a></h5><p>Well, sure, yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001728---ry"><em>[00:17:28]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001728---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001728---ry" title="Direct link to 001728---ry">​</a></h5><p>Well, that's great. Yeah, we're super excited, obviously, by all the possibilities that Pgrx brings to Postgres, and the great work you guys have done historically to get us to this point is much appreciated.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001742---eric"><em>[00:17:42]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#001742---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001742---eric" title="Direct link to 001742---eric">​</a></h5><p>Well, thanks. That's one of the reasons why we, TCDI donated Pgrx to the PG Central Foundation is to provide it a long term home for the Postgres community. TCDI is a litigation support company. We're not a database company, so to speak. So we wanted to get this stuff in the hands of a foundation that can help shepherd it forward and make sure that it can survive.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001809---ry"><em>[00:18:09]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001809---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001809---ry" title="Direct link to 001809---ry">​</a></h5><p>I imagine you have some open issues there that you could use help with. They're probably pretty hard to do, right? Like building a framework is a lot harder to building a thing with a framework. But are you looking for additional help from people to build out Pgrx?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001823---eric"><em>[00:18:23]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#001823---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001823---eric" title="Direct link to 001823---eric">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, for sure. I can't even tell you off the top of my head how many contributions we've had over the past four years that Pgrx has been alive. And it seems like every couple of weeks somebody new comes by with a new contribution. But yeah, one of the things that we're focused on right now is I guess it's two things kind of concurrently. One is we're improving Pgrx, is testing fundamentals, and it's both tying in more interesting things in CI like Valgrind, to different approaches to unit testing, which includes we're doing a big push on property testing right now within Pgrx. I think there's going to be some pull request landing in the next week or so with that. And we're also focused on improving some of the memory safety and soundness impedance mismatches between Postgres internals and Rust's compiler. So it's a big concerted effort to take a look at these issues.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001925---ry"><em>[00:19:25]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001925---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001925---ry" title="Direct link to 001925---ry">​</a></h5><p>Well, it seems like contributing to Pgrx could be like a gateway drug towards getting closer to helping with postgres itself. Right. Because you need to understand the internals to do anything in know, at least unless you're working on tests or yeah, I mean in general, adding new features to Pgrx means understanding postgres well enough to create that interface, which is big challenge.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001948---eric"><em>[00:19:48]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#001948---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001948---eric" title="Direct link to 001948---eric">​</a></h5><p>It does. And we myself and the others that on the decor development team there, we spend probably as much time in the postgres sources as we do actually writing code for it in.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002003---ry"><em>[00:20:03]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002003---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002003---ry" title="Direct link to 002003---ry">​</a></h5><p>You guys. If you come up with a big new release of Pgrx or any other extensions that you can think of, I'd love to have you back. Eric, it was great catching up with you.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002012---eric"><em>[00:20:12]<!-- --> - Eric</em><a href="#002012---eric" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002012---eric" title="Direct link to 002012---eric">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, sure.

Excited to chat with you today. How many postgres extensions have you authored in 2023?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000023---adam"><em>[00:00:23]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000023---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000023---adam" title="Direct link to 000023---adam">​</a></h5><p>Oh, it at least two.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000028---ry"><em>[00:00:28]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000028---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000028---ry" title="Direct link to 000028---ry">​</a></h5><p>At least two?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000029---adam"><em>[00:00:29]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000029---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000029---adam" title="Direct link to 000029---adam">​</a></h5><p>Well, in early 2023, I was just like, getting started and trying to figure out how to write one. And I know I wrote like a handful of them that didn't really do anything. I think the first one was just put like a rest server inside an extension and see what happens. Kind of didn't work very well.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000057---ry"><em>[00:00:57]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000057---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000057---ry" title="Direct link to 000057---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I remember that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000059---adam"><em>[00:00:59]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000059---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000059---adam" title="Direct link to 000059---adam">​</a></h5><p>I think I made like, a prometheus exporter, and then recently there were two ones that are kind of more useful.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000105---ry"><em>[00:01:05]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000105---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000105---ry" title="Direct link to 000105---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's great. Well, so obviously we know each other. We both worked together at Tembo. I mean, I could ask you questions as if I don't already know the answers, but since I do, I'm not going to do that. I was going to say getting into postgres, though, joining Tembo wasn't your first touch of postgres. Do you remember starting with, like I can't really quite remember when I started. But can you remember when you did?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000133---adam"><em>[00:01:33]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000133---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000133---adam" title="Direct link to 000133---adam">​</a></h5><p>Well, the first time I heard of postgres I'm pretty sure was like in undergrad, like database management systems class. And it was like, there's Oracle, there's these companies around it, and then there's open source stuff, postgresQL, you know? And I remember thinking, like, oh, that's And I probably Googled it and saw the elephant. And then I know I started using it in undergrad. I was doing some scientific computing stuff and I just needed somewhere to I didn't want to just keep writing to CSVs. I wanted to put it somewhere that was easier to search. And I just used postgres for it. Didn't really know what I was doing. It was just like, dump it into this database.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000221---ry"><em>[00:02:21]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000221---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000221---ry" title="Direct link to 000221---ry">​</a></h5><p>Nice, nice. And then as far as hacking postgres, that just started recently, or have you messed with the internals of postgres prior to this year?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000235---adam"><em>[00:02:35]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000235---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000235---adam" title="Direct link to 000235---adam">​</a></h5><p>Definitely not prior to this year. It's mostly focused on the application layer, building stuff on top of postgres. This year still getting deeper into the internals of postgres. I had installed some extensions before this year. Definitely didn't even think about how do you write build an extension, but it's.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000300---ry"><em>[00:03:00]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000300---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000300---ry" title="Direct link to 000300---ry">​</a></h5><p>Pretty easy to build them?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000301---adam"><em>[00:03:01]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000301---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000301---adam" title="Direct link to 000301---adam">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, that's very recent for me.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000302---ry"><em>[00:03:02]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000302---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000302---ry" title="Direct link to 000302---ry">​</a></h5><p>Pretty easy to build them. Right. Would you say?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000304---adam"><em>[00:03:04]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000304---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000304---adam" title="Direct link to 000304---adam">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. A shallow one is easy if you can learn rust. Yeah, it's a challenge. I think it's hard.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000317---ry"><em>[00:03:17]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000317---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000317---ry" title="Direct link to 000317---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I was kind of kidding.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000319---adam"><em>[00:03:19]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000319---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000319---adam" title="Direct link to 000319---adam">​</a></h5><p>And then there's like a learning curve, and then once you get over a curve, you can kind of get moving with it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000327---ry"><em>[00:03:27]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000327---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000327---ry" title="Direct link to 000327---ry">​</a></h5><p>Maybe. Let's talk about the extensions that you're, I guess, most proud of or have the most traction so far. What are those?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000339---adam"><em>[00:03:39]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000339---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000339---adam" title="Direct link to 000339---adam">​</a></h5><p>Pgmq, I think, has the most traction message queue extension. It's a lot like SQS Amazon's simple Queue service or Redisimple Message queue except on postgres. Well, we wrote it for Tembo to help run our cloud. We needed a message queue between Control Plane and Data Plane, so we wrote it for that. And then just in the last couple of months, we started kind of talking about it in the community. And after we wrote a blog about it, we've had a few people from the community that didn't know before who are now consistently contributing to the project. So Pgmq is definitely the one that I think has most traction.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000436---ry"><em>[00:04:36]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000436---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000436---ry" title="Direct link to 000436---ry">​</a></h5><p>And I think you're also working on well, you kind of have a stack of them, right? Because your other extension relies on Pgmq. True?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000448---adam"><em>[00:04:48]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000448---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000448---adam" title="Direct link to 000448---adam">​</a></h5><p>PG later.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000450---ry"><em>[00:04:50]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000450---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000450---ry" title="Direct link to 000450---ry">​</a></h5><p>Is that true?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000451---adam"><em>[00:04:51]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000451---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000451---adam" title="Direct link to 000451---adam">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. Okay. Yeah, PG later, that's another extension that lets you submit a query to Postgres and then forget about it and come back later and see the results from that query. And that's built on top of Pgmq. So it's like a stack of extensions.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000520---ry"><em>[00:05:20]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000520---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000520---ry" title="Direct link to 000520---ry">​</a></h5><p>Nice. I guess you're in the position now to be the extension mentor for others in the company who may be building extensions.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000529---adam"><em>[00:05:29]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000529---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000529---adam" title="Direct link to 000529---adam">​</a></h5><p>I know.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000529---ry"><em>[00:05:29]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000529---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000529---ry" title="Direct link to 000529---ry">​</a></h5><p>I just hired a co op who's working on one, and I imagine you're mentoring him to some degree.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000537---adam"><em>[00:05:37]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000537---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000537---adam" title="Direct link to 000537---adam">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, Jay talking about? Yeah, Jay's. Great. Hey, Jay. Jay, if you're listening yeah. Jay's been working on the another extension written in Rust, Clerk FDW. So it's a foreign data wrapper around Clerk, which is like our identity provider. We just want to be able to build this data warehouse that has our users and their organizations and have that data persisted in our data warehouse. So we built well, Jay is building that foreign data wrapper around Clerk, which is pretty cool.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000617---ry"><em>[00:06:17]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000617---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000617---ry" title="Direct link to 000617---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, we probably should give a shout out to Supabase for the Wrappers project that we're using to build that with. Sounds like it's been a pretty nice experience. Jay's a co op that just joined, like, last week and so already being very productive. So I'm excited. I think that there's the possibility of an explosion of new extensions for Postgres now that Pgrx allows us to use Rust. You agree with that?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000651---adam"><em>[00:06:51]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000651---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000651---adam" title="Direct link to 000651---adam">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it's pretty powerful because take this Clerk FDW, that extension that Jay's building. We can bootstrap the software together the same way as you might do outside of Postgres, but we don't have to spin up another resource somewhere, manage a pod or another VM, can package it up into an extension, use Supabase Wrapper. So that's a software that's already built. It's tested. We don't have to reinvent the wheel on that. We write the extension in Rust. So we pull in Rust libraries that are already built, already tested. Then we write our own tests on top of these things and then package it into our extension and then deploy it as part of the database. And then we can kind of just monitor the data there and not have to manage another service that could crash.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000754---ry"><em>[00:07:54]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000754---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000754---ry" title="Direct link to 000754---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it's pretty nice. So I was going to change a little bit to...you've also been using a lot of other people's extensions. Again, probably a lot more since joining Tembo than before, but what are some of your, I don't know, favorite extensions that you've been exposed to?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000815---adam"><em>[00:08:15]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000815---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000815---adam" title="Direct link to 000815---adam">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, you said PG Cron a few different places. There's another extension that I'm working on. It's, like, really early, but it's kind of wrapping up kind of some of the stuff that Langchain does in Python, but wrapping it up into an extension, pulling in PG vector into that, pulling in pg_cron, pulls in Pgmq and PostgresML as well. So it's like a bootstrapped extension. So all of those are pretty good PostgresML, pg_cron, pgvector, and they all have pretty good docs, so you can get up and running with them quickly and kind of figure out what you need to do.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000909---ry"><em>[00:09:09]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000909---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000909---ry" title="Direct link to 000909---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. So have you found that you've had to study the internals of postgres much as part of the process of building these extensions?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000923---adam"><em>[00:09:23]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#000923---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000923---adam" title="Direct link to 000923---adam">​</a></h5><p>Not really too much. Only when I'm having trouble getting it up and running for the first time do I need to really look at postgres. But a lot of these extensions don't. They're not like touching with hooks into and replacing core functionality of postgres. They're extending things. So a lot of what PostgresML does is just give you functions that go off and make rest calls or download data from elsewhere in the Internet and put it in your database for you, give you access to some pre trained machine learning models. And it's not changing fundamentally how postgres runs. It's still like the normal postgres. It's kind of like a layer on top of yeah. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001019---ry"><em>[00:10:19]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001019---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001019---ry" title="Direct link to 001019---ry">​</a></h5><p>I think some extensions can do surgery and some are, know, laying on top of and not messing with the core functionality.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001028---adam"><em>[00:10:28]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001028---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001028---adam" title="Direct link to 001028---adam">​</a></h5><p>Right? Yeah, it's an area I'm kind of new with that, so I haven't gotten super deep into replacing core functionality of postgres quite yet. But soon we'll probably start working in that space a little bit more.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001047---ry"><em>[00:10:47]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001047---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001047---ry" title="Direct link to 001047---ry">​</a></h5><p>What's, like the testing story? If you're a dev that likes to write TDD, test driven development, are you able to do that with extensions in particular, I guess, with Pgrx. What's the test driven story there look like?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001103---adam"><em>[00:11:03]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001103---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001103---adam" title="Direct link to 001103---adam">​</a></h5><p>Pgrx, I think, is pretty good. They have a way for you to say unit test or integration test for the extension that you're writing, so you can say, execute some queries and then make assertions on the outputs of those queries. So kind of like, have normal assertions that you would do in whatever language that you're testing. Pgrx has some tooling around like, oh, I want to spin up postgres 15.3, spin up a new environment for that, install your extension into it, and then run your test suite on it. Yeah, I guess it can get a little bit trickier, I think could be because depending on how complex the extension is, you could have system dependencies, um, like, oh, I need a specific version of GCC or something, or OpenSSL version something has to be installed. I haven't really quite found a good way to test all of those things to make it super portable to say, like, yep, all these test pass. And that means my extension is just good for everybody.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001228---ry"><em>[00:12:28]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001228---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001228---ry" title="Direct link to 001228---ry">​</a></h5><p>For the test running on your local machine. I know they're running on your local machine, but in a docker container or just natively.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001241---adam"><em>[00:12:41]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001241---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001241---adam" title="Direct link to 001241---adam">​</a></h5><p>You could do both, I guess. Kind of like my workflow for it. I guess I would do, like, run the test locally and then have the extension in a GitHub repo and have a CI pipeline that runs the same tests, but in Docker or within a GitHub workflow to be like, hey, before you merge this, you need to pass all these tests, kind of gate yourself a little bit.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001310---ry"><em>[00:13:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001310---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001310---ry" title="Direct link to 001310---ry">​</a></h5><p>That's great. Well, cool. So I was going to ask, as far as your background prior to Tembo, you were doing little ML engineering too. Did you use postgres much in that role? I guess the question is, did you use any of the special parts of Postgres or was it really just like a standard transactional store with little knowledge of the extension ecosystem?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001339---adam"><em>[00:13:39]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001339---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001339---adam" title="Direct link to 001339---adam">​</a></h5><p>Nothing too crazy. I've always tried to do a queue on postgres, so be like, build up this giant queue of things that a machine learning model needs to make predictions on, or make a bunch of different predictions, dump them into a queue, and then have another process. Look at all these predictions and pick the best one before giving it back to the user. But a lot of OLTP like high transaction workloads in kind of machine learning space. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001418---ry"><em>[00:14:18]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001418---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001418---ry" title="Direct link to 001418---ry">​</a></h5><p>So you said you've been trying to build queues historically, a lot of times in bigger companies, there are less tools for various tasks. For example, use redis if you want to build a queue, or use snowflake if you want to build a data warehouse. I don't even know that these things were officially declared by any sort of powers that be. It's more like the sales reps at those companies decided that this company is going to be a salesforce company or a snowflake company. Right. It's kind of a slow boil that you suddenly realize, oh, I guess we have kafka now. I guess we're a kafka shop and starts with a POC and then ends up you have all these tools. We call it the modern data stack. But yeah, I'm curious how your take on that in particular? Around start with the queue since you've just implemented it in postgres and probably had to use other tools in the past.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001516---adam"><em>[00:15:16]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001516---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001516---adam" title="Direct link to 001516---adam">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, a couple of places that I've worked at, it's like, hey, we need to pass messages between two services. And any engineer will be like, all right, well, we're going to evaluate what we have here. We want to try to do things like, oh, let's keep things simple, not make things too complex. And then depending on the size of the organization, it'll be like, well, we use Kafka for messaging, so use Kafka. And so it's like, okay, so make progress. A lot of times it's better to not fight that and just be like, we want to make progress, we just need our application to work. It's not like Kafka wouldn't work for this, but it's definitely overkill for a lot of situations. So then it's like, okay, we're going to build this in Kafka and maybe the rest of the application is in postgres, but this message piece of it, we're going to put it in Kafka. And from the application perspective, it's kind of no difference. Like I said, it's an overkill tool for a lot of use cases. But then when things start to go wrong and need to troubleshoot it, it's like, okay, now we have to bring in the Kafka expert.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001635---adam"><em>[00:16:35]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001635---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001635---adam" title="Direct link to 001635---adam">​</a></h5><p>And if it's a big company, it's probably a handful of people who are on this Kafka team and they got a lot of other stuff going on. So it's like, what do you have to do? You have to learn Kafka. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001647---ry"><em>[00:16:47]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001647---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001647---ry" title="Direct link to 001647---ry">​</a></h5><p>And you're a small use case, right? You're like a small unimportant use case. And so, yeah, you can't get their attention. You kind of accepted the fact that, okay, I can learn. It's kind of fun to learn new technologies and try new things out, right? That's the day. Zero joy of learning something new. But then now all of a sudden you've got to support it, right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001709---adam"><em>[00:17:09]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001709---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001709---adam" title="Direct link to 001709---adam">​</a></h5><p>Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001710---ry"><em>[00:17:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001710---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001710---ry" title="Direct link to 001710---ry">​</a></h5><p>You support what you make a lot of. Yeah, you got judoed into that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001716---adam"><em>[00:17:16]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001716---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001716---adam" title="Direct link to 001716---adam">​</a></h5><p>In my career, it was fun to learn Kafka and there's some things I really like about it, but then at the same time, it's a very complex tool and it does take a team to run and manage it. Same with RabbitMQ. If you're going to do those things, you need some people dedicated to making sure that they're functioning the way you expect it to.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001745---ry"><em>[00:17:45]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001745---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001745---ry" title="Direct link to 001745---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, well, I think kind of leads into one of our core missions at the company, which you're leading at Tembo, which is our stacks. I guess it probably would make sense for you to say a few words on what we're trying to accomplish with stacks at the company.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001805---adam"><em>[00:18:05]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001805---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001805---adam" title="Direct link to 001805---adam">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. So stacks are workload optimized postgres clusters. So the message queue stack is one that we have and our goal with that is if you need to run a message queue, we want this to be the most optimized way to do a message queue on postgres. Of course, there'll be a point in time when it's like, hey, your use case has grown so big that maybe that stack's not going to fit you, but that stack will be to the very edge of what postgres can do for that workload. We're taking that same approach with our OLAP stack that we're building right now. We have an OLTP stack, there's a machine learning stack. So each one of these stacks is do it on postgres and we're going to make it be the best possible squeeze every last piece of juice out of postgres that we possibly can for that workload.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001908---ry"><em>[00:19:08]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001908---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001908---ry" title="Direct link to 001908---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. And you're curating extensions for each stack. What else are you doing besides that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001913---adam"><em>[00:19:13]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#001913---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001913---adam" title="Direct link to 001913---adam">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, extensions are a big piece. A lot of that has to do with there are certain types of developer experience that we think people want around workloads. And then there's the postgres configuration itself. So like, what should shared buffers be or how many parallel worker processes and how should the auto vacuum vacuum error be tuned for that workload? That's a whole class of things that are unique to every stack. Of course, there's like a user interface component of every stack as well. So if you want to come up and to look and see and observe the stack, there'll be user interface metrics are kind of really tightly related to the UI, so there's different metrics for every stack as well. Some of them are going to be the same across stacks. But for example, current number of messages in a queue, that's like a metric that you can monitor, you can write alerts around that metric and it's mostly unique to the message queue workload.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002032---ry"><em>[00:20:32]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002032---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002032---ry" title="Direct link to 002032---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. And if the message queue stack is competing against a commercial queue product, they probably have some sort of visualization of the state of each queue.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002045---adam"><em>[00:20:45]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#002045---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002045---adam" title="Direct link to 002045---adam">​</a></h5><p>Right?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002046---ry"><em>[00:20:46]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002046---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002046---ry" title="Direct link to 002046---ry">​</a></h5><p>And so a postgres backed queue ought to have that same UI, that same monitoring tailored monitoring system. It makes it, I don't know how many times harder versus just configuration and curating some extensions, but I think it's all worth it to the user to be able to really defend their choice to use postgres for this use case against one of the modern data stack alternatives. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002120---adam"><em>[00:21:20]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#002120---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002120---adam" title="Direct link to 002120---adam">​</a></h5><p>Right? Yeah. I think something really useful that I like about having stacks and having postgres aligned to specific workloads, the complexity of an overall application can really come down a lot by running everything on postgres. You could still have separate postgres clusters for workloads, like a certain set of CPU and memory dedicated to mission critical process A and a separate one for this other mission critical process. But still when it comes to troubleshooting these things, you're troubleshooting postgres and it's not like, hey, I have to switch and be like, okay, now I'm troubleshooting Kafka, or jumping to Redis or jumping to Mongo or Snowflake. It's still like the context switching I think, for the developers is big time minimized when it's still the same underlying data store between all the different workloads, same technology. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002227---ry"><em>[00:22:27]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002227---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002227---ry" title="Direct link to 002227---ry">​</a></h5><p>And we have this vision of potentially having some built in stack connectivity, right, where these databases, if they're all kind of sitting back to back to back so you have five different stacks they could and should be able to communicate really well with each other. And you should be able to write queries across them in the same way that Citus allows you to write queries across an array of postgres clusters very efficiently. You should be able to do the same thing here and pull data from multiple stacks with a very nice user experience, again, without having to move data around. So that's one of the exciting things for me as a former airflow company founder. All these data pipelines are very painful between modern data stack companies. And one of the things I'm excited about is the possibility that we can give developers the option to not have to create all those pipelines.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002336---adam"><em>[00:23:36]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#002336---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002336---adam" title="Direct link to 002336---adam">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I'm really excited to work on that problem when we start doing that, but that'll be I think, a really big differentiator is to say I have ten different machines running postgres and I have a single pane of view across all of them. I think it's definitely doable. It'll be challenging.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002402---ry"><em>[00:24:02]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002402---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002402---ry" title="Direct link to 002402---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, it's a dream we're chasing. Yeah. Good. Well, I think it was great chatting with you, Adam. I'm sure we'll have you on the show again. I know that, again, you've got a lot more extensions coming and appreciate the work you've done for the community so far and yeah, looking forward to seeing your future work and talking about it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002428---adam"><em>[00:24:28]<!-- --> - Adam</em><a href="#002428---adam" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002428---adam" title="Direct link to 002428---adam">​</a></h5><p>Sounds good.

However, in the end, they are nothing but a large, complex series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCz4OMemCcA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matrix and vector operations</a>. These matrices and vectors have been trained to represent the semantic meaning of words.</p><p>In today's post, we will explore these meaning vectors and how they are related to Postgres. In particular, we are going to play with sentence transformers, vectors, and similarity search. All of that with the help of the pgvector Postgres extension.</p><p>Let’s go!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="from-words-to-vectors">From words to vectors<a href="#from-words-to-vectors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From words to vectors" title="Direct link to From words to vectors">​</a></h2><p>Like we said, a vector can represent many things, for example, the position of a character in a 3D video game, the position of a pixel in your screen, the force applied to an object, a color in the RGB space, or even the meaning of a word…</p><p>Word embedding refers to the technique by which words can be represented as vectors. These days, the embeddings offered by <a href="https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI</a> are very popular. However, other alternatives exist, like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">word2vect</a>, <a href="https://aclanthology.org/D14-1162.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glove</a>, <a href="https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FastText</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ELMo</a>.</p><p>Similarly, entire sentences can be represented as vectors using <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI embeddings</a> or <a href="https://sbert.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SentenceTransformers</a>, for example.</p><p>These models can be accessed through libraries for different languages.

This characteristic is the basis of a search technique called similarity search, where we simply find the nearest embedding vectors to find texts that are similar to our query.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="postgres-meets-language-models">Postgres meets Language Models<a href="#postgres-meets-language-models" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Postgres meets Language Models" title="Direct link to Postgres meets Language Models">​</a></h2><p>Models are great at generating content that seems credible, as shown earlier. However, you may have experienced cases where ChatGPT hallucinates answers or delivers out-of-date information. That's because LLMs are <strong>pre-trained</strong> using <strong>general data</strong>. And, because of that, creating a chatbot based only on the pre-trained data wouldn't be helpful for your customers, for instance.</p><p>The concept of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</a> acknowledges this limitation. </p><p>One way of overcoming these problems is to store your company's knowledge base in a database.... preferably in a vector database.

I’ve been looking forward to for the last few months and I’m excited to
see them get into the hands of users. Before we dive into the specific
features of this release, let’s discuss what a Postgres major release
actually means.</p><p>[postgres-16]</p><p>Postgres Releases</p><p>The PostgreSQL Global Development Group releases a new major version
every year with new features.</p><p>In addition, Postgres releases minor versions of each major release
every 3 months or so with bug fixes and security fixes. No new features
are released in minor versions, and that’s what makes major version
releases so exciting as it’s the culmination of about a year’s worth of
development work on the project.</p></blockquote><p>Which is an excerpt from <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/postgres-16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postgres 16: The exciting and the unnoticed</a>.</p><p>Let us look at what Postgres is doing behind the scenes, using <code>explain analyze</code>:</p><div class="language-console codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_D5yF"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-console codeBlock_RMoD thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_AclH"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Limit  (cost=28.07..28.08 rows=2 width=641) (actual time=1.069..1.071 rows=2 loops=1)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">   -&gt;  Sort  (cost=28.07..28.53 rows=181 width=641) (actual time=1.067..1.068 rows=2 loops=1)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">         Sort Key: ((embedding &lt;=&gt; '[&lt;your_vector&gt;]'::vector))</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">         Sort Method: top-N heapsort  Memory: 28kB</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">         -&gt;  Seq Scan on langchain_pg_embedding  (cost=0.00..26.26 rows=181 width=641) (actual time=0.036..0.953 rows=181 loops=1)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Planning Time: 0.079 ms</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Execution Time: 1.093 ms</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">(7 rows)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_aaMX"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_z5j7" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_FoOz"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_L0B6"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>We can observe that Postgres is sequentially scanning all rows.

Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000044---ry"><em>[00:00:44]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000044---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000044---ry" title="Direct link to 000044---ry">​</a></h5><p>That's awesome.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000045---marco"><em>[00:00:45]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000045---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000045---marco" title="Direct link to 000045---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000045---ry"><em>[00:00:45]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000045---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000045---ry" title="Direct link to 000045---ry">​</a></h5><p>So this is not really supposed to be an interview. It's more just us geeking out about Postgres, extensions, what they mean to users and opinions about anything and everything related to our work is fair game. Yeah, sounds good. So what'd you do before you got into Postgres stuff, out of curiosity?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000109---marco"><em>[00:01:09]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000109---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000109---marco" title="Direct link to 000109---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. My background is more in distributed systems, so I spent a few years at AWS. It was quite early days in AWS when I think I joined. There were three Web Services. S3, SQS and EC2.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000124---ry"><em>[00:01:24]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000124---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000124---ry" title="Direct link to 000124---ry">​</a></h5><p>Wow.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000125---marco"><em>[00:01:25]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000125---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000125---marco" title="Direct link to 000125---marco">​</a></h5><p>And then we built number Four, which was CloudFront, which gives people started using S3 for websites, which it wasn't really built for. But then we were asked to solve this and we built the CDN, and then we also built Route 53 for the DNS.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000140---ry"><em>[00:01:40]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000140---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000140---ry" title="Direct link to 000140---ry">​</a></h5><p>Wow.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000141---marco"><em>[00:01:41]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000141---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000141---marco" title="Direct link to 000141---marco">​</a></h5><p>And then yeah, I did a PhD in sort of self driving cars, but specifically like, cooperation between self driving cars, like, what if they can communicate with each other and sort of coordinate? So it's sort of advanced distributed systems in a way as well. Yeah. So that led to me joining Citus, which is sort of founded by former Amazon folks.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000205---ry"><em>[00:02:05]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000205---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000205---ry" title="Direct link to 000205---ry">​</a></h5><p>Got it. So building Citus was probably easy compared to all other stuff, actually.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000212---marco"><em>[00:02:12]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000212---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000212---marco" title="Direct link to 000212---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. If you do self driving cooperation between self driving cars, which is this kind of like life critical system distribute where your nodes kind of just move around and they move away from each other, it does make things relatively easy. But then yeah, building databases is never actually very easy.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000231---ry"><em>[00:02:31]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000231---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000231---ry" title="Direct link to 000231---ry">​</a></h5><p>No, I know. How good do you want to make it right? Is how hard it becomes.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000238---marco"><em>[00:02:38]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000238---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000238---marco" title="Direct link to 000238---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah. I guess the challenge is always everything sort of in the word relational. Right. Like everything relates to everything else. There's not like a feature you can implement without considering all the other aspects of the database and all the things that can happen concurrently with the operation that you're working on and all the possible ways in which things can fail. Especially if you're in a kind of distributed setup.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000301---ry"><em>[00:03:01]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000301---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000301---ry" title="Direct link to 000301---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think that's really interesting perspective. You think of all of the configuration options, too. Adding a new configuration option adds complexity, adds flexibility, adds potential complex, and it's tough.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000320---marco"><em>[00:03:20]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000320---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000320---marco" title="Direct link to 000320---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, definitely. I think one thing we learned is there's a sort of certain danger in creating modes where every setting you add, which can be on/off now you have two modes in your system. You add another setting that can be on/off. Now you have four modes in your system. It's kind of this exponential explosion of possible ways in which your database might be running. And so that's hard learned lesson that's, like, don't introduce major modes. Sometimes you have to because of backwards compatibility reasons, maybe, but you want to get rid of them over time.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000357---ry"><em>[00:03:57]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000357---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000357---ry" title="Direct link to 000357---ry">​</a></h5><p>Were you one of the first team members on Citus? Actually, I don't really know the full history. Did it start as a fork and made its way as an extension, or was it always an extension?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000410---marco"><em>[00:04:10]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000410---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000410---marco" title="Direct link to 000410---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I was one of the first, though I think Samay was already there. I think he's joined Tembo. So but yeah, we started out as a fork and then we called it CitusDB, and then we made it an extension and called it Citus. Though I think the name CitusDB kind of stuck around for...I still hear it sometimes. But yeah, it was very pretty early days for extensions. Like 2015 PostGIS obviously existed. It was one of the first major ones. But yeah, we were lucky at the time. We had Andres Freund working for us. Well, he's also now working for Microsoft, but he's like one of the top Postgres committers, and we put him in a room for a while, know, can you turn this into an extension, please? And he came up with some terrible, terrible hacks. But over time, those also drove some of the extension APIs in Postgres itself, where things that used to require really terrible hacks are now kind of more structured and you can introduce your own sort of data structures into Postgres without doing lots of weird stuff.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000522---ry"><em>[00:05:22]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000522---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000522---ry" title="Direct link to 000522---ry">​</a></h5><p>Well, I was thinking probably not everybody knows what Citus is. Maybe if you could give a quick I'd love to hear a quick overview of what it is and then maybe a couple of things that maybe you can think of that are unusual, that people might not know about it, that are part of it. I don't know if that's a stupid question, but yeah, if you could try no.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000541---marco"><em>[00:05:41]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000541---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000541---marco" title="Direct link to 000541---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, so it comes from basically this denotion that Postgres is ultimately limited to a single machine. I mean, you can read replicas, but you definitely cannot scale the writes. Usually if you have read replicas, they'll kind of end up having the same stuff in memory. So you cannot really scale the memory either. And so Citus is a solution to basically adds sharding to Postgres in a very transparent way, where you can have tables that are sort of transparently sharded across many nodes, you still connect to a Postgres server. There's just a table, looks, walks, and talks like a table. But if you insert into it, it actually gets rooted to a particular node. And if you insert another value, it might get rooted into another node that uses this hash distribution. And that way you can scale across infinitely many machines and have some users have petabytes of data in their Citus cluster part of the advantage is also that queries can get paralyzed on these tables because we can use all the nodes at the same time and multiple cores per node. But more and more it's also actually being used for LTP workloads.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000655---marco"><em>[00:06:55]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000655---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000655---marco" title="Direct link to 000655---marco">​</a></h5><p>And particularly the most popular use case is actually multitenancy, where you have this kind of B2B app where you have lots of relatively independent users and you kind of want to just transparently spread those across different machines without having to actually manage that yourself and figure out how to move data around. Because that was all very kind of automated. You can just ask it to rebalance your data and it does that using logical replication. And so then you have the advantage of just as much memory as you need to make your application fast and as much disk IOPS as you need by just adding more machines with more disks and so that helps you scale. And then we have a sort of managed service in Azure around that. But yeah, we use every hook that's available in Postgres to achieve things like starting with the planner hook. That's one of the interesting things about Postgres. It's like you just replace the whole planner with something else. You get a parsed query tree and then you can do whatever you want with it. You can just do some like okay, look at this query and log something interesting and then just go to the regular planner.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000812---marco"><em>[00:08:12]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000812---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000812---marco" title="Direct link to 000812---marco">​</a></h5><p>Or you could just do something completely different. And so we use all these hooks to kind of create this facade around Postgres tables where it's like Postgres table is still there, you just cannot touch it. We just intercept everything that's going on. The most recent and most terrible hack we did it was like the give it as this hack in Postgres so we can figure out so we have shards. Like the writes go into shards but then if you do logical decoding you see writes on shards, you don't see writes on these what we call distributed tables. But the user doesn't even know about shards probably. So how can we fix that? And there wasn't really any kind of hook we could use to change the way that the logical decoding process works except that we realized that the client specifies a decoder name usually just hard coded like Pgoutput or Wal2json or test_decoding and that actually refers to the name of a .so,  like a shared library. And we realized we could create a .so with the same name and put it in a different directory and then change the dynamic library path to be prefixed with that directory so it would load our library instead.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000934---marco"><em>[00:09:34]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#000934---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000934---marco" title="Direct link to 000934---marco">​</a></h5><p>This is kind of the worst thing we did. But it works nicely actually. I mean, that new .so file calls the original .so file and it kind of makes some changes to hide the sharding from the coding. But yeah, it is a hack. It's very much a hack. But it's nice that Postgres ultimately lets you do these kind of things.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="000959---ry"><em>[00:09:59]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#000959---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 000959---ry" title="Direct link to 000959---ry">​</a></h5><p>I think, like Citus says, there's like a requirement that Citus loads first as an extension. Is that true? I'm trying to remember if I'm making that up.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001008---marco"><em>[00:10:08]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001008---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001008---marco" title="Direct link to 001008---marco">​</a></h5><p>It is true. I mean, maybe it's a bit of laziness on our part, but it's also.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001013---ry"><em>[00:10:13]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001013---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001013---ry" title="Direct link to 001013---ry">​</a></h5><p>Because...</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001016---marco"><em>[00:10:16]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001016---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001016---marco" title="Direct link to 001016---marco">​</a></h5><p>We generate very weird plans that wouldn't make any sense to other extensions. So if you have multiple layers of planner hooks, you kind of want Citus to be but by putting it first, it actually becomes the last because everyone else overwrites Citus. And then hopefully when you go through the chain of planner hook, Citus is the last one remaining and it can produce some quirky distributed query plan that doesn't make sense to anyone else and pick that up.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001048---ry"><em>[00:10:48]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001048---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001048---ry" title="Direct link to 001048---ry">​</a></h5><p>Are there known extensions that aren't compatible with Citus that you're aware of or as far as you know? It kind of works with most everything.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001056---marco"><em>[00:10:56]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001056---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001056---marco" title="Direct link to 001056---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I mean, Citus is a little bit of a paradigm shift because now you have many servers and some extensions just don't make sense if you're on many servers because they keep their state on one of them and then they're not aware of others. But most things just work. But I kind of feel like there's this notion of a deep extension, if you will, like TimescaleDB or Citus. They kind of go really deep into planner hooks and change behavioral characteristics. Whereas something like PostGIS and a lot of extensions that just introduce new types and functions. They're sitting on top of this much more clean interface and usually the interoperability of those things is pretty good. But Timescale has this notion of a hyper table inside as a distributed table and you cannot really make a distributed hyper table. But yeah, compatibility, it comes down to sometimes also the individual features. It's not like if you install one, then the other doesn't work anymore. I mean, that happens for some extensions, but for Citus, most other things just kind of work with it. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001208---ry"><em>[00:12:08]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001208---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001208---ry" title="Direct link to 001208---ry">​</a></h5><p>So let's talk about pg_Cron. How early were you involved in that project?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001213---marco"><em>[00:12:13]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001213---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001213---marco" title="Direct link to 001213---marco">​</a></h5><p>Well, I created it. I used to have this thing where I am much more productive on flights and I flew to San Francisco a lot for a while and then I had a few of these projects that I was just working on on flights and pg_Cron was one of them. And so at the time we had customers who did kind of this real time analytics scenarios on Postgres on Citus. And those involve a lot of materialization. So a bunch of raw data keeps coming in like time series data. And at some point you want to take all the new data and kind of pre aggregate it inside of the database and that needs to happen periodically. I think the background worker concept was pretty new at the time. I don't know. This was many years ago. And so I realized you could do something like Cron. It maybe also comes from the Amazon background because Amazon, at least at the time, was all like glued together with Cron, Perl and R Sync. There were Cron jobs that would R sync metadata files to other servers and it was all pretty hacky. But anyway, I figured it would be pretty useful to have this kind of thing in Postgres also for just vacuuming or calling certain stored procedures that, I don't know, delete your old data.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001342---marco"><em>[00:13:42]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001342---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001342---marco" title="Direct link to 001342---marco">​</a></h5><p>Like those kind of maintenance tasks. It was just much easier if that's like you run a command once and then it works forever, rather than I need to maintain this separate infrastructure that periodically connects to the database and does that. So that became quite popular. I think pretty much all major managed services have pg_Cron now. Yeah, I kind of built it as a very I mean, it was definitely my side project. So I also built it as a very low maintenance thing that I wouldn't have to constantly fix bugs in. Also a little bit selective about adding new features. For a long time I resisted adding people want like, can I run a job every few seconds? And normally Cron is like at the minute, granularity. But recently I caved and I added doing it every few seconds because I realized it's kind of feature if there's some kind of issue, some kind of memory leak or whatever, if you run it every few seconds, it's going to be way worse than if you run it once a minute. So you need to be more careful in that case. But you can now also do like every second, for example, which is kind of useful.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001456---ry"><em>[00:14:56]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001456---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001456---ry" title="Direct link to 001456---ry">​</a></h5><p>That's awesome. Yeah, I was looking at we're just building a new data warehouse, trying to use Postgres to do that. I'm exploring all the columnar extension as well, which sort of is part of Citus. I don't know if you did any work on that, but yeah, looking at pg_cron versus pg_timetable, have you had the question of what about have you looked at timetable and its features and yeah, I'm kind of curious to get your assessment of the two.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001528---marco"><em>[00:15:28]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001528---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001528---marco" title="Direct link to 001528---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I've looked at it a mean for a long time. It wasn't so much an extension. I think nowadays it is more or less an autonomous extension, I think. Yeah, I mean, it's somewhat more complex in a way. I don't feel like competitive of like you should use pg_cron or use pg_timetable. I think pg_cron is just intentionally simple such just this very simple thing that just works and does what you'd expect it to mean almost unless your time zone is in a different unless you're not in GMT, then it sort of doesn't quite do what you'd expect it to anyway. So yeah, I think Cron is just simpler. But if you need some more specific, I guess it comes down to do you need the extra features that pg_timetable adds? But I think for most people, pg_cron is good enough because you can also just I've also seen people do their own kind of job queues on top of pg_cron, where you just have this thing that runs. Every few seconds or every minute, and then looks are there some jobs to do? And it actually executes the stuff that's in the job state.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001639---marco"><em>[00:16:39]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001639---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001639---marco" title="Direct link to 001639---marco">​</a></h5><p>So it's kind of composable as well. You can build your own things on top if you want. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001645---ry"><em>[00:16:45]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001645---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001645---ry" title="Direct link to 001645---ry">​</a></h5><p>And especially if you could trigger it every second to check for work. Yeah, that's just fine. Yeah, I'm coming from my previous company was doing Apache Airflow and so it's like kind of getting back to some of the stuff. I mean, obviously that's a very complicated system with a lot of capabilities and dag like chaining of tasks and fanning out and all that kind of stuff. But yeah, I think it's interesting to try to do some of that stuff inside of Postgres without requiring we're trying to go with the mantra of like just use Postgres for everything.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001729---marco"><em>[00:17:29]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001729---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001729---marco" title="Direct link to 001729---marco">​</a></h5><p>It's not a bad mantra. You've got, I guess, different levels of commitment to that idea of how much of our backend can we shove into Postgres? And there's these GraphQL extensions where you pretty much put your entire backend in Postgres. Yeah.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001751---ry"><em>[00:17:51]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001751---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001751---ry" title="Direct link to 001751---ry">​</a></h5><p>Your API, is there?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001752---marco"><em>[00:17:52]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001752---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001752---marco" title="Direct link to 001752---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I guess Supabase is going pretty long way in that direction, but at some point you want to debug stuff or you want to have certain rollout procedures. And sometimes Postgres is not as mature a tool as just shipping Python files somewhere. There's just better CI tools for most normal programming languages than for Postgres. So you have to find the right balance, I think.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001824---ry"><em>[00:18:24]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#001824---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001824---ry" title="Direct link to 001824---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, we're building and maybe this shouldn't have happened, but apparently yesterday we were working on a new FDW and I think it hit an exception that wasn't handled and it appeared to shut down the Postgres server. This is kind of fun. Should that have happened? Should that be possible? Should an extension error take it down? But we're still investigating that. But yeah, I think there's always risk with trying to do a lot inside, but I think with a mature extension that's well tested and battle tested, it should be. I mean, if you think about everything that's happening, there's no SRP in Postgres, right? It's not just doing one thing, it's got a vacuum. There's like lots of processes running and so then the question is, is it a sin to add one more thing? Especially if it has the capability to have a background worker? It's just like staring you in the face. Like use me.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="001929---marco"><em>[00:19:29]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#001929---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 001929---marco" title="Direct link to 001929---marco">​</a></h5><p>Like the extension APIs are slowly evolving from just a complete hacky approach for people to try out their Postgres batches before merging them into core. To some, I guess Extensibility was there from the start. But that's more too for custom types and custom functions than it is for planner hooks and background workers and those kind of things. Those are a little bit more what if we add this function pointer to see maybe extensions can do something interesting with it. And it's not very extremely well structured, but I mean the whole rust like pgrx and building extensions in rust, it does create an opportunity to have a little bit more of a well defined method of developing extensions.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002025---ry"><em>[00:20:25]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002025---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002025---ry" title="Direct link to 002025---ry">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I think what's interesting to me about Postgres is like the history of forks and it sucks to be on the true fork, as I'm sure you were aware. Creating the extension framework helps people out of the land of forks, but it does create the possibility for even more risk extensions in terms of all that. So it's like a double edged sword. I think it's great though, that to me is the reason why Postgres is doing so well now, is all that freedom that the core team has given the community in terms of how to use it. It's unprecedented, almost dangerous, but I also think empowering to developers who want to have some fun with their database.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002121---marco"><em>[00:21:21]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002121---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002121---marco" title="Direct link to 002121---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, definitely. What we also often find is just an extension versus an external tool. At least we're sort of in the business of running a Postgres managed service. But even if you have just your own Postgres servers, it has a fairly straightforward deployment model, right? Like you don't have to create a whole separate cluster with its own configuration that connects to your Postgres database and does things with it. You just shove it into your existing Postgres server and it'll restart the background workers and you don't have to worry about all those things. It does have a lot of merit, actually, to develop a software as a Postgres extension. I mean, it comes with its own protocol. I think the most interesting thing is just like you get all this synergy between all these different extensions, that the sum of the parts is greater than the or what is it? The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. But also things like PostGIS and Citus, they kind of layer like you can distribute it, geospatial joins, whatever. But then also maybe you have some interesting function and you can run it periodically using pg_cron.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002239---marco"><em>[00:22:39]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002239---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002239---marco" title="Direct link to 002239---marco">​</a></h5><p>And it's like all these things kind of give you this little platform where you can just by running SQL queries, do increasingly interesting things. Maybe you have an FTW that does an Http call and you run it using pg_cron, for example. And now your Postgres server is not just pg_cron, is not just Postgres cron, it's actually anything cron. Like you can reach out to other systems. So that plugability.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002310---ry"><em>[00:23:10]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002310---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002310---ry" title="Direct link to 002310---ry">​</a></h5><p>I literally have a co-op that started last week and his first task was, I said create an FDW for this API and use pg_cron and ingest that data. And he's like, well, how do I do it? Just brand new to data warehousing in general, but he's got the FDW built and now he's working on if he has any problems, I'll send him your way. Kidding. I won't. Kidding, kidding. I won't do that.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002341---marco"><em>[00:23:41]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002341---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002341---marco" title="Direct link to 002341---marco">​</a></h5><p>If there's bugs open issues like I'd like to know, of course.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002344---ry"><em>[00:23:44]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002344---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002344---ry" title="Direct link to 002344---ry">​</a></h5><p>But there's no bugs. No. So do you have any long flights coming up where you have some new extensions coming?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002351---marco"><em>[00:23:51]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002351---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002351---marco" title="Direct link to 002351---marco">​</a></h5><p>No, we had a baby last year. It's like my flight budget is very low at the moment. That's true.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002358---ry"><em>[00:23:58]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002358---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002358---ry" title="Direct link to 002358---ry">​</a></h5><p>Your latest extension is human.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002401---marco"><em>[00:24:01]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002401---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002401---marco" title="Direct link to 002401---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, but yeah, I'd like to play more with Rust because that the problem with extensions in the past. Like developing them in C has always been like c doesn't have any good sort of dependency framework. There's these old established library like, I don't know, LibZ and LibXML or something, like something that was developed 20 years ago and now, okay, every system has it, you can use it, but for anything newer than ten years, it's extremely annoying and hard to use a C library. And then even if you can figure out your configure and your make files, the memory allocation is probably going to not play nicely with Postgres. So that's where Rust is kind of interesting. Now there's this whole ecosystem of open source libraries that can potentially become extensions and we're still sort of at the very start of that, what's going to happen?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002505---ry"><em>[00:25:05]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002505---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002505---ry" title="Direct link to 002505---ry">​</a></h5><p>It's kind of scary because it could be very much of a Cambrian explosion. What happens if there are 300 new extensions that are worth adding? It's sort of a pain for the managed service providers.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002519---marco"><em>[00:25:19]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002519---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002519---marco" title="Direct link to 002519---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, definitely. Yeah. And they can have funny incompatibilities. It helps that then Rust is a little bit more safe and a little bit more not managed, but the memory allocation is a bit more sort of safe as well. But then, yeah, you can have a lot of weird bugs if you combine all these unknown bits of code.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002546---ry"><em>[00:25:46]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002546---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002546---ry" title="Direct link to 002546---ry">​</a></h5><p>That's great. Are there any extensions that you've run across either recently or in the past that you love, that you would mention as exciting? I mean, you mentioned PostGIS and anything else that you can think of. It's no big deal if not.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002604---marco"><em>[00:26:04]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002604---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002604---marco" title="Direct link to 002604---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, there's many. I'm sort of intrigued by Postgres_ML. It's like this just machine learning extension that they seem to be doing a lot of interesting things. I don't have a good use case for it myself yet, but I really like what you're doing. Also in Rust, I think MIT licensed, so it can be used in a lot of places. There's of course a lot of buzz around pg_vector and more recently pg_embedding, which is sort of an interesting kind of development because now I think they both added this HNSW indexes which are faster than the IFV flat indexes that pgvector provided. But then it also means they are now incompatible with the latest versions. You can create one or the other, not both, which is a little awkward. But I think that is where, of course, one of the most fastest moving areas and I think some of these things will be figured out.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002706---ry"><em>[00:27:06]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002706---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002706---ry" title="Direct link to 002706---ry">​</a></h5><p>Have you gotten those extensions added to the Citus managed service?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002711---marco"><em>[00:27:11]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002711---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002711---marco" title="Direct link to 002711---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, we definitely have pg_vector. Yeah, I mean, I think that took the landscape by storm. I think they're pretty much on every managed service now.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002719---ry"><em>[00:27:19]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002719---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002719---ry" title="Direct link to 002719---ry">​</a></h5><p>It's interesting, we're working on this thing called Trunk where we're trying to maybe I don't know if we can get you guys to participate, but the idea would be to send some metadata to some sort of central repository that we'd know, like which extensions are trending, waning, completely dead or not. I just think it's interesting as a new person coming into the Postgres ecosystem, there's just this library of potential extensions that it's pretty expansive and kind of trails off in a know because you can find them loosely here or there on GitHub. But I think having a better directory of them would be good for the community.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002804---marco"><em>[00:28:04]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002804---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002804---marco" title="Direct link to 002804---marco">​</a></h5><p>Yeah, I guess. One thing that's also tricky about extensions, it's like you'd want it in an ideal world, you write it once and then it works forever. In the real world, every Postgres version potentially breaks your extension, so someone has to actually go and fix it. For new Postgres versions, sometimes it's okay. I think with pg_cron, I had like once or twice. It's like I think Postgres 16 didn't actually no, it did require some fixes. I think there was one Postgres version which didn't require any fixes. Maybe PG 15, I was already happy. But usually C is a bit of this wild west of programming languages. But yeah, sometimes just some function header changes, there's an extra argument and then none of the extensions that use that function compile you have to have some level of maintenance behind each extension. Well, not every extension does well. Great.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002903---ry"><em>[00:29:03]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002903---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002903---ry" title="Direct link to 002903---ry">​</a></h5><p>I mean, it was great to chat with you. Happy to have you back on again. If you have a big new release of Citus, I don't know, do you guys have any big plans for it or has it reached a certain point of stability where it is what it is? Yeah, I'm kind of curious.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002919---marco"><em>[00:29:19]<!-- --> - Marco</em><a href="#002919---marco" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002919---marco" title="Direct link to 002919---marco">​</a></h5><p>Well, our most recent major release added this kind of notion of Schema based Sharding, where so far it's always been like you have distributed tables and you have a distribution column and you need to pick which columns you use. But the Schema based Sharding is just like every Schema becomes its own group, own Shard, essentially, so it might be on a different node. So for apps that use Schema per tenant, that's a very nice model. And so we're investing more in that at the moment.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="002949---ry"><em>[00:29:49]<!-- --> - Ry</em><a href="#002949---ry" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 002949---ry" title="Direct link to 002949---ry">​</a></h5><p>Well, great. Good to meet you. Looking forward to continuing to get to know you.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The maxim of building a product is to know your user. However, any company big or small will often have user data spread around in various systems. A data platform team will often deploy various pipelines that can sync data from various sources into a data warehouse. As an alternative, Postgres supports the concept of a Foreign Data Wrapper. Let’s dive into what this is and how it can help us.</p><p>In this blog, we'll look at <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/clerk_fdw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clerk_fdw</a>—a tool that bridges the gap between <a href="https://clerk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clerk</a>, a leading user management solution, and your very own Postgres Database. By the end, you'll discover how this integration can empower you to make data-driven decisions, optimize your pricing strategy, and refine your market approach. Let's get started!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="whats-a-foreign-data-wrapper">What’s a Foreign Data Wrapper?<a href="#whats-a-foreign-data-wrapper" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s a Foreign Data Wrapper?" title="Direct link to What’s a Foreign Data Wrapper?">​</a></h2><p>A foreign data wrapper is an extension available in PostgreSQL that allows you to bring ‘foreign data’ (i.e. data in a different Postgres DB, a different database like DB2, or even a different kind of data source, like an API) and query it the same way you would query a normal Postgres table. They are particularly useful when your data may be segregated into different databases, but are still related in ways that you could gather some useful information from them. In building a foreign data wrapper for Clerk.com, we have used <a href="https://supabase.github.io/wrappers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supabase Wrappers</a> that make it easier to build Foreign Data Wrappers and interact with third-party data using SQL.</p><p>If you should take something away from this blog, is that Postgres’ Foreign Data Wrappers are a great tool to build an analytics platform based on Postgres. See examples of other <a href="https://pgt.dev/?cat=connectors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FDWs in Trunk</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="whats-clerk">What’s Clerk?<a href="#whats-clerk" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s Clerk?" title="Direct link to What’s Clerk?">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://clerk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clerk</a> is a user management tool. With Clerk, users experience a seamless sign-up and sign-in flow, whether they prefer using email, SMS, or even their favorite social media accounts. Its versatility and developer-friendly APIs make it an excellent choice for us at Tembo for both efficiency and a superior user experience.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="the-power-of-integration">The Power of Integration<a href="#the-power-of-integration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Power of Integration" title="Direct link to The Power of Integration">​</a></h2><p>Being able to access data from a User Management Tool like Clerk as part of your data platform is especially useful because it enables you to have a 360-degree view of the user experience on your product, without having to set up any complex data export pipelines from Clerk into other systems.</p><p>In fact, we built <code>clerk_fdw</code> at Tembo to address needs in our internal analytics pipeline . Here are some of the ways we are using it:</p><ul><li>Run advanced analytics that combine internal data with user data from Clerk.</li><li>Understand user interaction patterns with our product.</li><li>Identify and engage with top users.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="clerk" src="/assets/images/clerk-flowchart-ecda66b28a07b45684d4932e0aac931a.png" title="clerk_fdw structure" width="1345" height="1158" class="img_SS3x"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="setting-up-clerk_fdw">Setting up <code>clerk_fdw</code><a href="#setting-up-clerk_fdw" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to setting-up-clerk_fdw" title="Direct link to setting-up-clerk_fdw">​</a></h2><p>The first step would be installing the <code>clerk_fdw</code> extension.

Then, withing each partition it will find only rows for the employee being queryed using the index, then it would scan the remaining rows, probably typically zero, one, or two rows, to find the correct salary.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="expiring-old-versions">Expiring old versions<a href="#expiring-old-versions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expiring old versions" title="Direct link to Expiring old versions">​</a></h2><p>Earlier in this blog, we configured <strong>pg_partman</strong> to partition in 1 minute increments, to expire partitions that are older than 15 minutes, and to check every 30 seconds.

partitions. I have old versions expiring after 10 minutes. I thought it's interesting to note that <strong>pg_partman</strong> is preemptively creating partitions for the future, in this case 5 minutes into the future.</p><p>If you refer to the original set up steps, I have configured <code>infinite_time_partitions = true</code>, and this means we will generate partitions even when we are not generating any data for them. I think this is the proper configuration since we also have a retention policy that will drop the old partitions. The concern of making infinite partitions as time passes, even if no data is being generated, is not applicable because old tables are being dropped.</p><p>To confirm data was being deleted, I sampled the above query over time, and we can see the large body of inserts moving up into the oldest available partitions, then falling outside of the retention policy and being deleted.</p><div

I hope that you are inspired to try out extensions on your own and see what they can do. The next time you have some problem to solve with your data, consider that maybe it could just be handled by a Postgres extension.</p><p>If you want to try extensions without any local setup, you should try Tembo Cloud at <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud.tembo.io</a>.</p><p>Just use Postgres!</p>]]></content>

Expression) to obtain the first <code>{limit}</code> message IDs whose <code>vt</code> has expired. (It would be interesting to discuss why pgmq developers used a CTE, but we can explore that in another post.)</p><p>There are two crucial things to notice in the CTE. One is the <code>order by</code> clause that ensures the FIFO ordering. The other one is the <code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code> clause, claiming the rows no one else has claimed. This part is essential because it ensures correctness in the case of concurrent  <code>pgmq.read()</code> operations. </p><p>The next step in the DML is to update the corresponding rows with a new vt value by adding the supplied <code>{vt}</code> to the current timestamp. Additionally, the <code>read_ct</code> value is incremented by 1. What is the use of this counter? In general, we can suspect that there is a problem processing a given message if it has a high <code>read_ct</code> value because users usually archive the message after successfully processing it. So, ideally, a message is only read once. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="pgmqarchive">pgmq.archive()<a href="#pgmqarchive" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to pgmq.archive()" title="Direct link to pgmq.archive()">​</a></h3><p>The next stage in the lifecycle of a message is archiving it.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In case you missed it, Postgres 16 came out last week - and this year it arrived earlier than the last few years. There are many features that I’ve been looking forward to for the last few months and I’m excited to see them get into the hands of users. Before we dive into the specific features of this release, let’s discuss what a Postgres major release actually means.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="postgres-16" src="/assets/images/postgres-16-1cfe231777e20520fac3b292397f20e6.png" title="PG16" width="1666" height="1140" class="img_SS3x"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="postgres-releases">Postgres Releases<a href="#postgres-releases" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Postgres Releases" title="Direct link to Postgres Releases">​</a></h2><p>The PostgreSQL Global Development Group releases a new <em>major</em> <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version</a> every year with new features. </p><p>In addition, Postgres releases minor versions of each major release every 3 months or so with bug fixes and security fixes. No new features are released in minor versions, and that’s what makes major version releases so exciting as it’s the culmination of about a year’s worth of development work on the project. </p><p>While there's a case to be made for faster release of features, Postgres prides itself on stability and this release cadence provides enough time for features to be proposed, reviewed, committed and tested before they get shipped.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="should-i-upgrade-to-postgres-16">Should I upgrade to Postgres 16?<a href="#should-i-upgrade-to-postgres-16" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Should I upgrade to Postgres 16?" title="Direct link to Should I upgrade to Postgres 16?">​</a></h2><p>If you are building a new application, yes, I would recommend that you start with the latest major version of Postgres. This will guarantee the latest and greatest features, and a continuous flow of minor releases that fix bugs and improve the security of your database.</p><p>If you are upgrading an existing system, there are more factors to consider. The general advice is to <strong>upgrade minor versions</strong> always - because they contain security and bug fixes and the risk of not upgrading is higher. </p><p>However, for major versions, you will need to consider the tradeoffs as the major versions usually change the internal format of system tables and data files. That means, you can’t just use previous versions of the data directory — you’ll need to use <code>pg_dump</code> / <code>pg_restore</code> or <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg_upgrade</a> to upgrade. In addition, depending on the features you are using and the Postgres release, manual changes to your code or queries may also be required.</p><p>Obviously, another important factor if you are using a managed service provider is when they provide support for Postgres 16. At <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Cloud</a>, we’ve already started working on supporting Postgres 16 and expect it to be available in a few weeks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="whats-most-exciting-about-postgres-16">What’s most exciting about Postgres 16?<a href="#whats-most-exciting-about-postgres-16" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s most exciting about Postgres 16?" title="Direct link to What’s most exciting about Postgres 16?">​</a></h2><p>Postgres 16 delivers exciting features in all aspects of the database ranging from performance improvements, monitoring enhancements, better security and privilege handling, replication improvements, new server features and commands and a lot more. </p><p>If you’re interested in the complete list of features, you can read the detailed <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-16.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release notes</a>. Below, I’ll talk about the aspects of this release which excite me the most and we will talk about a few not-so-talked about features which lay the groundwork for more exciting features in Postgres 17.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="logical-replication-improvements">Logical replication improvements<a href="#logical-replication-improvements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Logical replication improvements" title="Direct link to Logical replication improvements">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Logical replication</a> is a feature I’ve always been interested in, as it allows you to expand the capabilities of Postgres by moving data between different Postgres databases or from Postgres to other databases. It finds interesting use cases in: replicating selectively from one database to another, replicating across Postgres versions, online migrations and allowing consolidation from multiple databases.</p><p>This release, arguably the most exciting logical replication feature, is allowing <a href="https://pganalyze.com/blog/5mins-postgres-16-logical-decoding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">logical replication from standby servers</a>. Prior to this feature, you could only create a logical replication slot on the primary which meant adding more replicas would add more load on the primary. With Postgres 16, secondaries also have the ability to create replication slots allowing for more distribution of that load. What’s more is that the replication slots on the secondary are persisted even when the standby is promoted to the primary. This means that subscribers won’t be affected even during a failover! You can read more about this feature in Bertrand’s <a href="https://bdrouvot.github.io/2023/04/19/postgres-16-highlight-logical-decoding-on-standby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>.</p><p>The short of it is that now you can do this on a Postgres 16 standby:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_D5yF"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_RMoD thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_AclH"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">postgres@standby=# select pg_is_in_recovery();</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> pg_is_in_recovery</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">-------------------</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> t</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">(1 row)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">postgres@standby=# SELECT * FROM pg_create_logical_replication_slot('active_slot', 'test_decoding', false, true);</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  slot_name  |    lsn</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">-------------+------------</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> active_slot | 0/C0053A78</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">(1 row)</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_aaMX"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_z5j7" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_FoOz"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_L0B6"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>On Postgres 15, the same thing would have errored out:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_D5yF"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_RMoD thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_AclH"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">postgres@standby=# SELECT * FROM pg_create_logical_replication_slot('active_slot', 'test_decoding', false, true);</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">ERROR:  logical decoding cannot be used while in recovery</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_aaMX"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_z5j7" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_FoOz"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_L0B6"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>In addition to this, there are a number of other logical replication performance improvements.

While Postgres provides a number of statistics tables with monitoring information, I believe more can be done to provide actionable insights to users. As an example, Lukas pointed out several interesting gaps in Postgres monitoring in his <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/events/pgcon_2020/sessions/session/132/slides/49/Whats%20Missing%20for%20Postgres%20Monitoring.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PGCon 2020 talk</a>.</p><p>Coming back to this release, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-IO-VIEW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>pg_stat_io</code></a> has to be the most useful piece of information added to the Postgres stats views in Postgres 16. It allows you to understand the I/O done by Postgres at a more granular level, broken down by <code>backend_type</code> and <code>context</code>. This means you can calculate a more accurate cache hit ratio by ignoring the I/O done by VACUUM, differentiate between <code>extends</code> and <code>flushes</code>, and separate out bulk operations while deciding which configurations to tune. Melanie talks about this and much more in her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCzSNdUOEdg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talk</a> and this <a href="https://www.depesz.com/2023/02/27/waiting-for-postgresql-16-add-pg_stat_io-view-providing-more-detailed-io-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> approaches how you would use this as a DBA.</p><p>Here is an example of the statistics you can see in <code>pg_stat_io</code>:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block"

<code>last_seq_scan</code> and <code>last_idx_scan</code> on <code>pg_stat_*</code> tables which allow you to understand index usage better and figure out when plans for a query might have changed.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="special-mentions">Special mentions<a href="#special-mentions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Special mentions" title="Direct link to Special mentions">​</a></h3><p>Like I said, each release comes with many improvements - and I could not outline them all in a blog post (and if I did, nobody would read it!). But I do want to mention a few other items in Postgres 16 that I won’t be able to dive deeper into but are interesting as well.</p><ul><li>Load balancing with multiple hosts in <code>libpq</code>: This feature allows to balance the load across Postgres read replicas directly within <code>libpq</code> (which is the foundational Postgres client library) without having to use another load balancer. You can read <a href="https://mydbops.wordpress.com/2023/05/07/postgresql-16-brings-load-balancing-support-in-libpq-psql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this blog post</a> on how this new feature is implemented and can be used.</li><li>Performance: I won’t repeat what’s in the release notes but there’s a long list of performance improvements in this release. There’s support for more parallelism on <code>FULL</code> and <code>OUTER</code> <code>JOINs</code> and on more aggregates, greater usage of incremental sorts, window function optimizations and even an upto 300% performance improvement in <code>COPY</code>.</li><li><code>VACUUM</code> improvements: Last thing I’d mention is improvements to <code>VACUUM</code> which include freezing performance improvements, ability to increase (or decrease) shared buffer usage by <code>VACUUM</code>, and faster loading of <code>VACUUM</code> configs.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="laying-the-groundwork-for-an-exciting-postgres-17-and-beyond">Laying the groundwork for an exciting Postgres 17 (and beyond)<a href="#laying-the-groundwork-for-an-exciting-postgres-17-and-beyond" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Laying the groundwork for an exciting Postgres 17 (and beyond)" title="Direct link to Laying the groundwork for an exciting Postgres 17 (and beyond)">​</a></h2><p>All of the features mentioned above can immediately add a lot of value to your Postgres usage, but there are new features which lay the groundwork for powerful features in future releases. I’ll quickly touch upon three items that I believe are noteworthy:</p><ul><li>Direct IO and Async IO in Postgres: In Postgres 16, several building blocks for implementing direct and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD0w3gWBF7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asynchronous IO</a> for Postgres were committed. This includes reduced contention on the relation extension lock and addition of Direct IO as a developer only option via the <code>debug_io_direct</code> setting. This important but hard work has been ongoing for several releases and Postgres 17 will likely be the first release where users will be able to utilize these features.</li><li>Moving towards Active Active replication: A feature was committed in Postgres 16 to allow logical replication to avoid replication loops, which is when a transaction gets replicated from source to target and back. Postgres 16 allows subscribers to process only changes which have no origin which allows you to prevent these loops. Bi-directional active-active replication is still very complicated and requires solving a lot of problems, but this feature tackles one of those important sub-problems.</li><li>Migration of the build system to Meson: This might have slipped under your radar but in this release, Postgres added support for a new build system which is expected to replace the Autoconf and Windows based build systems. Why, you might ask? Andres makes a compelling case for it in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/20211012083721.hvixq4pnh2pixr3j%40alap3.anarazel.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this thread</a> if you’re interested but some reasons include faster build times, simpler dependency management and moving towards a common build system across Linux and Windows.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="postgres-continues-to-deliver">Postgres continues to deliver<a href="#postgres-continues-to-deliver" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Postgres continues to deliver" title="Direct link to Postgres continues to deliver">​</a></h2><p>With every new release, Postgres becomes more and more compelling and adds great features that improve the experience of its users. I recommend you check out the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-16-released-2715/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a>, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-16.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the release notes</a> to see everything coming along with this new release.</p><p>And if you want to try out the full power of Postgres including its powerful extension ecosystem on a managed service, try out <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Cloud</a>.</p>]]></content>

These are often implemented by a library, but can also be implemented in other ways, for example using a procedural language like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PL/pgSQL</a>.</p><p><strong>Hooks:</strong> A Postgres feature informally called <em>hooks</em> can be used to connect into Postgres' existing functionality. Hooks allow for overwriting default Postgres functionality, or calling back into an extension's code at the appropriate time. For example, one type of hook can modify Postgres start up behavior to launch a background worker, and a different type of hook can be used to redirect queries to a different table.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_uH4V"><div class="admonitionHeading_P5_N"><span class="admonitionIcon_MF44"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_yySL"><p>Sometimes extensions are instead referred to as 'modules', but I like to simply refer to everything as an 'extension', but feel free to @ me on X to tell me why that's wrong (<a href="https://twitter.com/sjmiller609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@sjmiller609</a>).</p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="enter-the-matrix">Enter the matrix<a href="#enter-the-matrix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enter the matrix" title="Direct link to Enter the matrix">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="im-in-matrix" src="/assets/images/im-in-matrix-dc7fbaffd858e30723ad62d60ebdd4a3.gif" width="498" height="278" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>A big part of what I have been working on is fully automating enabling any extension.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For years, Postgres has been considered among the most popular and advanced open source OLTP databases. Interestingly, 20 years ago, it was a competition between Postgres and MySQL and this debate is still going on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35906604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">today</a>. 🙂 Over the last few years, Postgres added more features and its ecosystem added more extensions and now the comparison list keeps growing. After adding support for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/9.4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jsonb</a> in 9.4, Postgres began to be compared with MongoDB as users started using Postgres to store unstructured data. With <a href="https://github.com/citusdata/citus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citus</a>, people started using Postgres over other distributed SQL technologies for use cases such as multi-tenancy and analytics. And this phenomenon continues to grow with <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pgvector</a>, <a href="https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timescaledb</a> and others.</p><h1>Use Postgres for Everything</h1><p>Postgres has evolved to where people have started talking about using “Postgres for everything.” There’s strong agreement that it’s wise to use Postgres until you find a strong reason for why you can’t use it anymore - either a very specialized use case, or scale which can’t be achieved by Postgres. This topic was well-discussed on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33934139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hacker news</a> thanks to a <a href="https://www.amazingcto.com/postgres-for-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> by a friend, Steven Schmidt.</p><p>And to clarify, when I say Postgres, I mean the entire Postgres ecosystem - this includes Postgres, its extensions and ecosystem tooling for high-availabilty, backups, connection pooling, etc. All of these together turn Postgres into a powerful data platform which you can use to run diverse workloads. However, it’s easier said than done.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="making-postgres-for-everything-real">Making “Postgres for Everything” real<a href="#making-postgres-for-everything-real" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Making “Postgres for Everything” real" title="Direct link to Making “Postgres for Everything” real">​</a></h2><p>Advanced users may know the recipe which turns Postgres into a distributed database, a vector database, an OLAP database or a search store, but this is still inaccessible to most developers. Over years of working with Postgres users, I’ve realized that even tuning Postgres for OLTP (which is a fairly well known use case) is very hard for most developers. For example: OLTP deployments often have badly chosen indexes, over / under provisioned hardware, insufficiently tuned autovacuum etc. even though they are running on managed services which do the heavy lifting for them.</p><p>So, expecting developers to be able to figure out how to use Postgres for all these use cases when there are other databases focused on user experience for one particular use case is unrealistic. Even though developers know that dealing with 5 different databases is a pain in the medium to long run, when they are starting, they care about getting off the ground fast. So, to expect everybody to use Postgres for everything, we need to make it possible for every user to have easy access to the recipes which turn Postgres into the database for the data service of their choice.</p><h1>Enter Tembo Stacks</h1><p>Tembo stacks are pre-built use-case-specific Postgres deployments which are optimized and tuned to serve a specific workload. They aim to be a replacement for other databases which you actually don’t need, but you are considering because you don’t know how to solve that problem using Postgres. They help you avoid the pains associated with learning, managing and deploying other database systems. Some examples of Stacks are: OLTP, Message Queue, Data Warehouse, Enterprise LLM and Document Store.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="defining-a-stack">Defining a stack<a href="#defining-a-stack" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Defining a stack" title="Direct link to Defining a stack">​</a></h2><p>A stack is a recipe of how to run an optimized Postgres for a workload, expressed as a spec file. The spec includes the following components:</p><ul><li>Docker Base Image containing a particular version of Postgres</li><li>Curated set of extensions which turn Postgres into best-in-class for that workload.</li><li>Hardware profile which is best suited for that workload</li><li>Postgres configs optimized according to hardware and workload</li><li>Use-case specific metrics, alerts and recommendations</li><li>On-instance sidecar - Kubernetes Services to Deploy a containerized application near Postgres to expand capabilities while minimizing network latency</li></ul><p>Let’s look at an example of a stack spec for a <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/blob/main/tembo-operator/src/stacks/templates/message_queue.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Message queue</a> stack - an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQS</a> / <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RabbitMQ</a> replacement based on Postgres.</p><p>It has the following components:</p><ul><li>A standard Postgres 15 base image</li><li>Curated extensions: <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pgmq</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg_partman</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pg_stat_statements</a></li><li>Optimized Postgres configs: Aggressive autovacuum settings, reduced random_page_cost and Checkpoint and WAL configs tuned for a high throughput Postgres instance</li><li>CPU::Memory ratio recommendations for hardware</li><li>Message queue specific metrics like queue length, oldest message age, newest message age</li><li>(Coming soon) pg_bouncer</li></ul><p>This and many other such stack specifications are <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/tembo/tree/main/tembo-operator/src/stacks/templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a> and can be used to deploy a stack locally on a self-managed instance or fully managed on Tembo Cloud. This is a reflection of one of our core values - to always put developers first. We open source our stacks to create the best development experience: locally and on the cloud, and to invite community feedback and collaboration.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="deploying-a-stack-on-tembo-cloud">Deploying a stack on Tembo Cloud<a href="#deploying-a-stack-on-tembo-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Deploying a stack on Tembo Cloud" title="Direct link to Deploying a stack on Tembo Cloud">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://cloud.tembo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Cloud</a> is a dev-first, fully-extensible, fully-managed, secure, and scalable Postgres service. It has the ability to take this stack spec and deploy a Postgres instance which is built using this stack spec. With Tembo Cloud, you can get all the benefits of a managed service like: backups, high availability, scaling of storage and compute, metrics and alerts with an easy to use UI and CLI. And you get access to an ever growing list of <a href="https://pgt.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extensions</a> which you can add to your stack or bring your own extensions to deploy on Tembo Cloud.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="image" src="/assets/images/image-cae704f1f54958b9c0cff9d1ea5cb41d.png" width="2920" height="2076" class="img_SS3x"></p><h1>Evolving Postgres to be the data platform for everything</h1><p>We know we’ve embarked on a challenging journey to turn Postgres into the data platform for Everything. But, we strongly believe that with the power of Postgres and its ecosystem, it’s possible to replace most deployments of esoteric databases with just a flavor of Postgres and save developers a lot of time and effort.</p><p>We’ll be building many stacks, benchmarking them against “competitive” solutions, and making sure Postgres grows to tackle these workloads. We’ll have to optimize Postgres, support a wide variety of extensions, write several new extensions to close feature and performance gaps with other databases and also evolve Postgres. But, we have no doubt that we, along with the Postgres community can make this happen!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Database systems use various techniques to ensure transactionality and performance. For Postgres, this is called MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control). MVCC allows Postgres to provide great performance even when multiple clients could be working with the same table concurrently.</p><p>It is useful to be aware of Postgres' MVCC implementation to understand how Postgres manages a table's physical storage. Internally, Postgres refers to rows as “tuples”. And as a baseline, there are two big ideas to keep in mind about how Postgres implements changes to rows in a table:</p><ul><li>An UPDATE operation in Postgres is equivalent to a DELETE of the previous tuple, plus an INSERT of the new one.</li><li>A DELETE operation in Postgres does not cause the data to be removed from physical storage. It only causes it to be marked as deleted.</li></ul><p>This is why Postgres has the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html#AUTOVACUUM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autovacuum</a> process: It is the automatic process in charge of cleaning up and optimizing table storage for Postgres. You can follow this blog post with a local test environment of Postgres. I will demonstrate with code how MVCC and VACUUM features work, and how to tune the Auto-vacuum process.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="why-does-it-matter">Why does it matter?<a href="#why-does-it-matter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why does it matter?" title="Direct link to Why does it matter?">​</a></h2><p>Vacuum is not just about cleaning up storage space. In environments where data undergoes constant change, Postgres tables often experience an excessive amount of Inserts, Updates, and Deletes. This activity can lead to table bloat. Table bloat happens when a table's physical footprint far exceeds the size of the data that it actually holds.</p><p>Table bloat is a condition that if not managed, will likely hamper performance of our database. And so, this takes us back to the autovacuum process: to extract its maximum benefits, you may need to fine-tune its settings.</p><p>Postgres's default autovacuum settings are pretty good. If you're like me, it could have been years into your postgres journey before having a negative experience with bloat. However, when the time came I found it challenging to understand and tune these configuration settings. That's why we will study them safely in a dev environment.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="unraveling-the-mystery-of-bloat--vacuums-role">Unraveling the Mystery of Bloat &amp; Vacuum's Role<a href="#unraveling-the-mystery-of-bloat--vacuums-role" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Unraveling the Mystery of Bloat &amp; Vacuum's Role" title="Direct link to Unraveling the Mystery of Bloat &amp; Vacuum's Role">​</a></h2><p>PostgreSQL's mechanism for handling bloat is unique due to its adherence to MVCC. Contrary to immediate space reclamation after data is deleted or becomes obsolete, Postgres tags these rows as "dead", or “dead tuples”. However, even though they are dead they still occupy disk space and will degrade the performance of your queries. Many queries will continue to scan through these tuples, despite their “dead” status. The auto-vacuum steps in here, ensuring that these rows are removed and both the table and its associated indexes are streamlined for performance. You can't scan the dead tuples if they no longer exist!</p><p>To illustrate, let us create some bloat and see how it affects a rowcount query:</p><p>Create a table we can easily manipulate, and let's disable autovacuum so we can observe the consequences.</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div

For every iteration, let's insert a row to our “bencher” table. Then, let's read and update a single record. Finally, let's delete the same record. This will create a situation similar to many queue implementations (<a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like PGMQ</a>), where there are at least 2 transactions for every 1 insert.

We are benchmarking an expensive set of queries, and you've probably noticed the sawtooth pattern in the plot and a high standard deviation relative to the latency. This is a symptom of bloat accumulating on our table. Query latency grows until the vacuum process clears dead tuples, and then grows once again. This also has an inverse impact on transactions per second (TPS). Ideally we can reduce and provide some stability to latency.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="balancing-vacuum-delay-for-optimal-system-performance">Balancing Vacuum Delay for Optimal System Performance<a href="#balancing-vacuum-delay-for-optimal-system-performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Balancing Vacuum Delay for Optimal System Performance" title="Direct link to Balancing Vacuum Delay for Optimal System Performance">​</a></h2><p>Vacuuming is indispensable. However, it is not free and if left unchecked, it can burden your system. The balance lies in <code>autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay</code> and <code>autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit</code>. <code>autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay</code> is the amount of time that the autovacuum process will halt processing when the <code>autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit</code> is reached. Imagine this series of events - a table reaches 10% bloat, meaning 10% of the tuples are dead. When the 10% threshold is reached, the autovacuum worker begins to work and starts accruing cost. When that cost reaches <code>autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit</code>, it will pause for the duration specified by <code>autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay</code>, and then continue working until it is complete.</p><p>Modifying these can craft the perfect balance between seamless vacuuming and system efficiency. Let's increase the cost limit to the max, and reduce the delay by  half. This will let the autovacuum process run longer and pause for a shorter period of time when it does reach the cost limit, to ideally reduce bloat faster and reduce query latency.</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_mQmQ theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_D5yF"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sql codeBlock_RMoD thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_AclH"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">ALTER</span><span class="token plain"> SYSTEM </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">SET</span><span class="token plain"> autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">'10ms'</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">ALTER</span><span class="token plain"> SYSTEM </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">SET</span><span class="token plain"> autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token number" style="color:#36acaa">10000</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">SELECT</span><span class="token plain"> pg_reload_conf</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_aaMX"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_z5j7" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_FoOz"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_L0B6"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="delay_cost_limit" src="/assets/images/delay_limit-cd8db2fe56a5809a912c8d92bcbab133.png" title="delay-cost-limit" width="1000" height="600" class="img_SS3x"></p><p>We have a slight reduction in average latency, but we can still see that the obviously grows in latency over time and decrease in TPS.

We covered the absurdly high churn use case on a single-table today, which is very similar to what we see when running applications using PGMQ. Vacuum is complicated and can be <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/postgresql-vacuum-and-analyze-best-practice-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tuned differently</a> when considering multiple tables with different workloads. Other OLTP use cases will call for different settings, and OLAP workloads may be less influenced by the vacuum settings .

If you've used <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-example#examples-of-asynchronous-queries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snowflake's asynchronous queries</a>, you might already be familiar with this capability. Submit your queries to Postgres now, and come back later and get the query's results.</p><p>You can try pg_later on <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Cloud</a> as part of our <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/tembo-stacks/machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning Stack</a>. </p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_uH4V"><div class="admonitionHeading_P5_N"><span class="admonitionIcon_MF44"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>Machine Learning Stack</div><div class="admonitionContent_yySL"><p><a href="https://cloud.tembo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Cloud</a>'s Machine Learning Stack is powered by <a href="https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">postgresml</a> and pg_later, but also ships with Postgres configurations optimized for message queue workloads. We also provide additional metrics and data visualizations specific to message queues.</p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="why-async-queries">Why async queries?<a href="#why-async-queries" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why async queries?" title="Direct link to Why async queries?">​</a></h2><p>Imagine that you've initiated a long-running maintenance job. You step away while it is executing, only to come back and discover it was interrupted hours ago due to your laptop shutting down. You don't want this to happen again, so you spend some time googling or asking your favorite LLM how to run the command in the background with screen or tmux. Having asynchronous query support from the beginning would have saved you a bunch of time and headache!</p><p>Asynchronous processing is a useful development pattern in software engineering. It has advantages such as improved resource utilization, and unblocking of the main execution thread.</p><p>Some examples where async querying can be useful are:</p><ul><li>DBAs running ad-hoc maintenance.</li><li>Development in interactive environments such as a Jupyter notebook. Rather than submit a long-running query only to have your notebook hang idly and then crash, you can use asynchronous tasks to avoid blocking your notebook, or simply come back later to check on your task.</li><li>Long-running analytical queries. For example, fulfilling an ad-hoc request like seeing how many new users signed up each day overthe past month. You can submit that query and have it run in the background while you continue other work.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="extending-postgres-with-async-features">Extending Postgres with async features<a href="#extending-postgres-with-async-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Extending Postgres with async features" title="Direct link to Extending Postgres with async features">​</a></h2><p>pg_later is similar, you can dispatch a query to your Postgres database and rather than waiting for the results, your program can return and retrieve the results at your convenience.</p><p>A common example is manually executing <code>VACUUM</code> on a table. Typically, one might execute VACUUM in one session and then use another session to check the status of the VACUUM job via <code>pg_stat_progress_vacuum</code>. pg_later gives you the power to do that in a single session. You can use it to queue up any long-running analytical or administrative task on your Postgres database.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="stacking-postgres-extensions">Stacking Postgres Extensions<a href="#stacking-postgres-extensions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stacking Postgres Extensions" title="Direct link to Stacking Postgres Extensions">​</a></h2><p>pg_later is built on top of <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/introducing-pgmq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PGMQ</a>, another one of Tembo's open source extensions. Once a user submits a query, pg_later seamlessly enqueues the request in a Postgres-managed message queue. This mechanism then processes the query asynchronously, ensuring no unnecessary wait times or hold-ups.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bgworker.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postgres background worker</a> picks up the query from the queue and executes it. The results are persisted by being written to a table as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSONB</a> and can be easily retrieved using the pg_later API. You can simply reference the unique job id given upon query submission and retrieve the result set, or query the table directly. By default, the results are retained forever. However, we are building retention policies as a feature into pg_later.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="diagram" src="/assets/images/diagram-d6cbc048f614b1157a4ebdcdf011e537.png" title="diagram" width="2146" height="800" class="img_SS3x"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="using-pg_later">Using pg_later<a href="#using-pg_later" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Using pg_later" title="Direct link to Using pg_later">​</a></h2><p>To get started, check out our project's <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/pg_later/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">README</a> for a guide on installing the extension.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="initializing-the-extension">Initializing the Extension<a href="#initializing-the-extension" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Initializing the Extension" title="Direct link to Initializing the Extension">​</a></h3><p>First, you need to initialize the extension.

We also provide additional metrics and data visualizations specific to message queues.</p></div></div><p>Some exciting features of the project include:</p><ul><li>Guaranteed exactly-once delivery of messages within a visibility timeout</li><li>Optional archival of messages retention for replayability and retention</li><li>Familiar SQL interface</li><li>Single and Batch read of messages</li><li>Client SDKs in both Rust and Python for an ORM-like feel</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="the-need-for-message-queues">The need for message queues<a href="#the-need-for-message-queues" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The need for message queues" title="Direct link to The need for message queues">​</a></h2><p>Message queues are a very common architectural feature used to manage operational pipelines, particularly for asynchronous tasks and distributed systems. There are products in the market that support message queues (Kafka, RSMQ, RabbitMQ, SQS); however, when adopting one of these technologies, you increase your cognitive load, required skills and production support overhead.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="building-your-queues-on-postgres">Building your queues on Postgres<a href="#building-your-queues-on-postgres" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building your queues on Postgres" title="Direct link to Building your queues on Postgres">​</a></h2><p>While building our own infrastructure, we ran into a need for a job queue to manage tasks between our control-plane and data-plane in our managed cloud offering. Our control-plane publishes tasks like <code>create postgres cluster</code>, and <code>update postgres cluster</code>. </p><p>Since we are a Postgres startup, we decided to build the queue on Postgres. Note that we are not the first to do this! Companies like <a href="https://dagster.io/blog/skip-kafka-use-postgres-message-queue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dagster</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/message-queuing-using-native-postgresql" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CrunchyData</a> have also implemented queues on Postgres and written about it; PostgresFM even dedicated <a href="https://postgres.fm/episodes/queues-in-postgres" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an entire podcast episode</a> to queues.</p><p>We are the first, however, to wrap it all up in a Postgres extension and share the implementation with the community.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="queues-implemented-with-best-practices">Queues Implemented with best practices<a href="#queues-implemented-with-best-practices" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Queues Implemented with best practices" title="Direct link to Queues Implemented with best practices">​</a></h2><p>PGMQ was implemented on Postgres and follows industry best practices. One of the most important practices is the use of Postgres's <a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-locked-for-in-postgresql-9-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SKIP LOCKED</a>, which is similar to <code>NOWAIT</code> in other databases. <code>SKIP LOCKED</code> helps ensure that consumers don't hang. This is generally paired with <code>FOR UPDATE</code>, which locks the message and ensure it is not read twice. PGMQ also supports partitioning, which is particularly beneficial for large queues and can be used to efficiently archive / expire old messages.</p><p>PGMQ provides exactly-once delivery semantics within a visibility timeout. Similar to Amazon's SQS and RSMQ, PGMQ consumers set the period of time during which Postgres will prevent all consumers from receiving and processing a message.

There's roughly 10x more transactional than analytical data, mostly in Oracle, MySQL, and Postgres, and there have been some sizable shifts to this landscape in recent years:</p><ol><li>We saw some analytical workloads move to the cloud. This was the big data era, resulting in the rise of platforms like Snowflake and Databricks.</li><li>Some transactional workloads moved to streaming and real-time data. This required transactional and analytical processing platforms to be managed by app developers, not database admins.</li><li>Application infrastructure has been abstracted, allowing developers to build and scale applications more efficiently. Services like Vercel and Netlify have streamlined the development lifecycle, but tend to build on top of databases rather than dealing with the databases themselves.</li></ol><p>The net result? Exactly what we see around us—an ever-expanding menagerie of innovative apps and services built upon an increasingly complex database ecosystem. The modern data stack is more complicated and expensive than it's ever before, and with the normalization of AI, the trend is accelerating. How can we cope?  </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="postgres-as-a-platform">Postgres as a Platform<a href="#postgres-as-a-platform" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Postgres as a Platform" title="Direct link to Postgres as a Platform">​</a></h2><p>Developers would love an open-source, multi-functional data platform to simplify their lives and work—as long as it doesn't restrict their freedom. Companies, meanwhile, want reliability, flexibility, and a pathway out of the spiraling costs and vendor lock-in attempts that they're currently saddled with.
At face value, there's an obvious solution that ticks all the necessary boxes:
Postgres.</p><p>Postgres, the world's favorite database with millions of deployments, features a liberal OSS license and a large community. It efficiently manages SQL and JSON queries across diverse workloads, and handles low latency, high throughput analytical cases, offering HTAP-lite capabilities through window functions and foreign data wrappers. Known for its extensibility and ACID compliance, it stands out as a reliable and cost-effective system.</p><p>Even better, its extensibility has resulted in a wide ecosystem of add-ons and plugins for GIS data, image processing, vector databases, and more, with some extensions evolving into companies like CitusDB and Timescale. In short, everything you’d want and then some.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Postgres is most admired and desired" src="/assets/images/postgres_is_admired_and_desired_stackoverflow-de1207ee92eac0debfe8053dc1fb80a1.png" width="1852" height="1032" class="img_SS3x">
<em>Source: <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-databases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023</a></em></p><p>Problem solved, right? Not so fast. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="overwhelment">Overwhelment​<a href="#overwhelment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overwhelment​" title="Direct link to Overwhelment​">​</a></h2><p><em>(It's a word now. Go with it.)</em></p><p>Companies are typically hesitant to adopt databases due to costs, complexity, and risk. The effort required to build, configure, and optimize a new system often makes the transition value negligible at best. For these companies (especially large enterprises that spend billions per year on a fragmented database architecture), Postgres and its assimilation of database innovations should be an ideal solution. Open source, extensible, free from vendor lock-in and ever-increasing costs—it should be a no-brainer.
“What's the holdup?” you might ask. Well, Postgres is... complicated. </p><p>To create a self-managed cluster of Postgres clusters, DBAs have to consider infrastructure, environment, security, data management, backups, and workload-specific tuning., Maintaining and scaling Postgres also involves meeting high availability requirements, managing data storage, updating schemas, optimizing query performance, and managing failover protection and caching. And while extensions exist to support additional functionality in Postgres, they are hard to discover, evaluate, certify and deploy.</p><p>Put simply, Postgres is the solution… if you can tame it and make it manageable.  </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="our-vision">Our Vision<a href="#our-vision" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our Vision" title="Direct link to Our Vision">​</a></h2><p>This is where Tembo comes in. Tembo is the managed cloud to run Postgres and its entire ecosystem—extensions, applications, tools, and more—all within a single unified platform.</p><p>Tembo simplifies deploying Postgres with a virtualized runtime experience, enabling one-click migrations and access to the Postgres ecosystem. Developers can control the data model lifecycle, and deploy to multiple zones and clouds. Advanced options will include autoscaling, hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP), and edge caching.</p><p>Additionally, Tembo invests in the Postgres extension ecosystem, aiming to standardize and simplify the use and creation of extensions. By unbundling and decoupling the database into services and abstraction layers, Tembo enables new simplicity and capability.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="tembo-cloud">Tembo Cloud<a href="#tembo-cloud" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tembo Cloud" title="Direct link to Tembo Cloud">​</a></h2><p>Tembo Cloud is Postgres the way it <em>should</em> be. With Tembo, you don't have to be a database expert to build an expert database. We are building a dev-first, fully-extensible, fully-managed, secure, and scalable Postgres service. Available on all clouds and bare metal providers, Tembo Cloud provides the largest curated library of easily installed extensions, allowing our customers to expand their use cases of Postgres.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Organization home" src="/assets/images/org_home-d9bedbb2673b1b2475dc367da497d3cf.png" width="2662" height="1564" class="img_SS3x"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Instance home" src="/assets/images/instance_home-ba650017410b6ebf93b19106b6ed0ee0.png" width="2684" height="1452" class="img_SS3x"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="tembo-stacks">Tembo Stacks<a href="#tembo-stacks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tembo Stacks" title="Direct link to Tembo Stacks">​</a></h2><p>Stacks accelerate your development by enabling you to quickly create and deploy custom-built "flavors" of Postgres + extensions that are tailor-made for key enterprise needs. No need to spin up new databases and endure the pain and associated sprawl—Stacks enable you to replace external, non-Postgres data services. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="what-does-this-mean">What Does This Mean?<a href="#what-does-this-mean" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Does This Mean?" title="Direct link to What Does This Mean?">​</a></h2><p>No matter who you are or what you're trying to build, three things are true about Tembo:</p><ul><li>True Managed Open Source: You don't have to settle for a complex web of OSS data services or a restrictive, locked-in, expensive managed contract with one of the large cloud providers. Tembo is committed to making true open-source Postgres manageable and accessible.</li><li>Developer Centric: You can have the flexibility and control you've dreamed of. Tembo is made by developers, for developers. We give you fast deployment, automatic migration, and a clear path to genuine value. We win when you win.</li><li>Future Proof: Postgres is beloved by developers. It isn't going anywhere, and with the constantly growing ecosystem of extensions and applications, it's only getting better. With Tembo, you get all the potential of that ever-growing network, right at the click of a button.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_JmGV" id="100b-going-on-200b">$100B going on $200B<a href="#100b-going-on-200b" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to $100B going on $200B" title="Direct link to $100B going on $200B">​</a></h2><p>That's the expected size of the global database market in 2023 and 2027. The amount of data being generated, stored, and leveraged is growing exponentially, as is the need for applications to operate at a global scale. We're producing more data, we need it faster, and the uses for it are more and more complex by the day. </p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_uH4V"><div class="admonitionHeading_P5_N"><span class="admonitionIcon_MF44"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>Try it out</div><div class="admonitionContent_yySL"><p>We invite you to sign up for <a href="https://cloud.tembo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tembo Cloud</a>, and unlock the full power of the Postgres ecosystem.</p></div></div>]]></content>

This is partly because the current user experience of discovering, installing, and gaining proficiency in Postgres extensions is subpar—especially compared to other ecosystems. This has been voiced by many community members.
