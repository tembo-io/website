# Introduction

👋 Tembo will help you say **goodbye to database sprawl, and hello to Postgres**. Collapse the modern data stack with a unified developer platform.

💸 Using many data platforms is expensive and complicated. Instead, **focus on your data** and just use Postgres.

🪄 Check out our  **[Tembo Stacks](/docs/category/tembo-stacks)** to understand what we're all about.

🧐 Tembo is the **Postgres developer platform** for building every data service. Our mission is to collapse the database sprawl of the modern data stack with a unified developer platform. With Tembo, developers can quickly create and deploy specialized data services using Stacks, pre-built Postgres configurations, and deployments without complex builds or additional data teams.

## Tembo Cloud

⚡️ We invite you to try out our managed Postgres service, [Tembo Cloud](https://cloud.tembo.io).
