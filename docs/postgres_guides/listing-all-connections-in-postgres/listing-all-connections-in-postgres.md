# Listing all connections to Postgres

There are 2 different methods to list down all the connections present in Postgres database - using SQL query and using PgAdmin. In this guide, we will explore these two methods and discuss the step-by-step process to run them.

Letâ€™s get started

## Using SQL query

**Step 1** - Open you terminal and connect it to the Postgres database. Check out guide to follow the steps, [click here](https://tembo.io/docs/postgres_guides/how-to-connect-to-postgres/)

**Step 2** - To get the details of all connections created in each Postgres database, run this sql query

```
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;
```

:::info
`pg_stat_activity` displays the information about the current activity of database connections present in PostgreSQL database server. Check out the official documentation to learn more about it, [click here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-ACTIVITY-VIEW)

- **dataid** - It shows the Object ID of the connected database.

- **datname** - It shows the names of the connected database. It gives the human-readabale name of the database connected with the session.

- **pid** - It shows the process ID (pid) of teh backend server process associated with the session. There is a backend process for each individual active session.

- **usesysid** - It lists down the system identifier of all the users who has started the session.

- **application_name** - It shows the names of the client application that started the session. In many cases, it is defined by the client application while building a connection to the session.

- **backend_start** - This column represents the timestamp when the backend process was initiated.

## Using PgAdmin

**Step 1** - Open the **Databases** by expanding the **Servers** in Object Explorer.

**Step 2** - Navigate to the **Dashboard** section present on the right-hand side.

**Step 3** - There you will see the **Sessions** tab present in the **Server activity** section. It will display the list of all connections created in each database.

Along with _Server Activity_, it shows some other important statistics as well - Server Sessions, Transitions per Second, Tuples In and Tuples Out, Block IO.

- **Server Sessions** - It shows the details about the sessions or connections that are currently goin on in the PostgreSQL server.

- **Transactions per Second** - It represents the rate or time at which the transactions are being treated by the database server.

- **Tuples In and Tuples Out** - Tuples In shows the number of rows added to the database. Tuples Out shows the number of rows fetched from the database.

- **Block IO** - It shows the input and output operations performed on the disk blocks.
